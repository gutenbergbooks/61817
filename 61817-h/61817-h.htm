<h2 class="nobreak">NOTICE TO PARENTS.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> those intervals of rest which the serious cares
and labors of life imperiously demand, a man may
find the best amusement for himself in efforts for
the amusement of children. This little work and
its predecessor, &#8220;<span class="smcap">Rollo Learning to Talk</span>,&#8221; have
been written on this principle.</p>

<p>Parents find it very difficult to <i>employ</i> little children.
&#8220;Mother, what shall I do?&#8221; and sometimes
even, &#8220;Mother, what shall I do after I have done
this?&#8221; are heard so often that they sometimes exhaust
even maternal patience. These little volumes
will, we hope, in some cases, provide an answer to
the questions. The writer has endeavored to make
them such that children would take an interest in
reading them to themselves, and to their younger
brothers and sisters, and in repeating them to one
another.</p>

<p>The difficulty with most books intended for children
just learning to read, is that the writers make
so much effort to confine themselves to <i>words of one
syllable</i>, that the style is quaint and uninteresting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
and often far more unintelligible than the usual language
would be. The author&#8217;s design here has
been, first to interest the little reader, hoping, by
this interest, to allure him on to the encounter of
the difficulties in the language, and to the conquest
of them. Hence, the more difficult words and
phrases, in common use, are not <i>avoided</i>, for the
very object of such a reading book should be to
teach the use of them. They are freely introduced
and rendered intelligible by being placed in striking
connections, and familiar, by being frequently
repeated. By a wonderful provision in the structure
of the mind, children thirst for repetition,&mdash;the
very thing essential to give security and permanence
to the knowledge they acquire.</p>

<p>The subjects of the articles, accordingly, and the
method of treating them, are in the highest degree
juvenile. But the language is mature. For it is
language which we wish to teach them, and consequently
we must keep, in language, a little above
them, advancing continually ourselves, as <i>they</i> advance.</p>

<p class="ph1"><span class="large">ROLLO LEARNING TO READ.</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h2 class="nobreak">HOW ROLLO LEARNED TO READ.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Should</span> you like to know how Rollo
learned to read? I will tell you. It is
very hard work to learn to read, and it
takes a great while to do it. I will tell
you how Rollo did it.</p>

<p>One evening Rollo was sitting on the
floor by the side of the fire, playing with
his blocks. He was trying to build a
meeting-house. He could make the meeting-house
very well, all except the steeple,
but the steeple <i>would</i> tumble down.</p>

<p>Presently his father said,</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>&#8220;Rollo, you may put your blocks into
the basket, and put the basket in its
place, in the closet, and then come to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rollo obeyed.</p>

<p>Then Rollo&#8217;s father took him up into
his lap, and took a little book out of his
pocket. Rollo was glad. He thought he
was going to look at some pictures. But
he was disappointed.</p>

<p>He was disappointed; that is, he found
there were no pictures in the book, and
was sorry.</p>

<p>His father said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you thought there were
pictures in this book.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Rollo.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are none,&#8221; said his father; &#8220;I
have not got this book to amuse you. I
am going to have you learn to read out
of it, and learning to read is hard work.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>Rollo was very glad when he heard
this. He wanted to learn to read, so that
he could read story books himself alone,
and he thought that learning to read was
very pleasant, easy work.</p>

<p>His father knew that he thought so,
and therefore he said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you are glad that you are
going to learn to read, but it is harder
work, and will take longer time than you
think. You will get tired very often, before
you have learned, and you will want
to stop. But you must not stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; said Rollo, &#8220;must not I stop
once&mdash;at all&mdash;all the time, till I have
learned to read?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; said his father; &#8220;I do not
mean that you must be learning to read
all the time;&mdash;you will only read a little
while every day. What I mean is that
you must read every day, when the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
comes, although you will very often think
that you are tired of reading so much, and
had rather play. But no matter if you
are tired of it. It is your duty to learn to
read, and you must do it, if it is hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think I shall be tired,&#8221; said
Rollo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&mdash;you can see. Only remember
if you should be tired, you must
not say so, and ask not to read.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rollo&#8217;s father then opened the book
and showed Rollo that it was full of letters,&mdash;large
letters, and small letters, and
a great many little words in columns. Do
you know what a column is? There was
also some very easy reading in large print,
but no pictures.</p>

<p>Then Rollo&#8217;s father explained the plan
by which he was to learn to read. His
sister Mary was to teach him. Mary was
to call him to her every morning at nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
o&#8217;clock, and teach him his letters for a
quarter of an hour. She was to do the
same at eleven, and at three, and at five.
The rest of the time Rollo was to have
for play. Mary was to take three or four
of the letters at a time, and tell Rollo the
names of them, and make them on the
slate, and let him try to make them, and
let him try to find them in books, until he
should know them perfectly. She was to
keep an account of every day, marking
the days when, for any reasons, she did
not hear him, and putting down, each day,
the letters he learned that day, and as
soon as he had learned all his letters she
was to tell his father.</p>

<p>If he should at any time refuse to come
when she called him, or come sullenly or
in ill humor,&mdash;or if he disobeyed her, or
made her any trouble, wilfully, she was to
put the book away at once, and not teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
him any more that day, but at night tell
his father.</p>

<p>When Rollo&#8217;s father had thus explained
the whole plan, he said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mary and Rollo, this is a hard
task for both of you, I know. I hope you
will both be patient and persevering,&mdash;and
be kind to one another. Mary, you must
remember that Rollo is a small boy, and
cannot learn as fast as you might expect
or wish,&mdash;you must be kind to him and
patient. Be sure also to be punctual and
regular in calling him at the exact hour.
And Rollo you must be patient too, and
obedient, and you must remember that
though it is hard work to learn to read,
you will be very glad when you shall have
learned. You will then enjoy a great
many happy hours in sitting down by the
fire in your little chair, and reading story
books.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Soon after this Rollo went to bed thinking
a great deal of his first lesson, which
he was going to take the next day.</p>

<p>Do you not think now that it would
have been better if Rollo&#8217;s father had tried
to make learning to read more amusing to
his little boy? He might have got a book
with letters and pictures too,&mdash;or he might
have bought some blocks and cards with
letters on them, and let Rollo learn by
playing with them. That would have
been more amusing. Do you think that
would have been a better way? I think
it would not. For if Rollo had begun to
learn to read, expecting to find it play, he
would have been disappointed and discouraged
a great deal sooner. He might
have looked at the pictures in his book,
or played with the cards or the blocks,
but that would not have taught him the
letters on them. It was better that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
should understand distinctly at the beginning
that learning to read was hard work,
and that he must attend to it <i>as a duty</i>;
thus he would be prepared for it as it
was, and find it more and more pleasant
as he went along. But if he had expected
that it would be play, he would only
have been disappointed, and that would
have made it harder, and made it take a
great deal longer time.</p>

<p>Rollo liked reading very well for a day
or two, but he soon became tired. He
thought the quarter of an hour was very
long, and that Mary always called him too
soon. He was mistaken however in this,
for Mary was always very exact and
punctual. He found too that he got along
very slowly. It was a good many days
before he could say the first few letters,
and he thought it would take a great while
before he should have learned them all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
One pleasant morning, when he was digging
with his little hoe, in the yard, Mary
called him, and for a minute or two he had
a great mind not to come. But then he
recollected that if he did not, she would
immediately put the book away and tell
his father at night, so he threw down the
hoe and ran. But it was very hard for
him to do it.</p>

<p>In a few days one thing surprised both
Mary and Rollo. It was that he learned
the second four or five letters a great deal
sooner than he did the first. They did
not understand the reason of this. The
third lesson was learned sooner still, and
so on, the farther they went down the
alphabet the faster Rollo learned.</p>

<p>One evening when Rollo had learned
about half his letters, his father took him
up in his lap, and took a small round box
out of his pocket, with a pretty picture on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the top. Besides the picture there were
three letters; they were these, A, B, C.
Rollo looked a moment at the picture, but
he was more pleased with the letters than
the picture. He was very much pleased
to see those letters,&mdash;the very letters
which he had learned, on the top of such
a pretty box.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh there is A,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and B, and
C, on the top of this pretty box. How
funny!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then his father opened the box and
poured out a great many beautiful round
cards into Rollo&#8217;s lap. There were beautiful,
painted pictures on one side and
letters on the other. Rollo was most
interested in looking at the letters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, father,&#8221; said he, &#8220;what beautiful
cards! Why did you not buy them at
first, and let me learn my letters with
them?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said his father, &#8220;if I had
bought them at first, when you did not
know any of your letters, you would have
not been pleased with any thing but the
pictures, and rolling the cards about the
floor. Or if I had given them to Mary to
teach you your letters from them, then
you would not have liked them any better
than your book. But by letting you learn
for a time from your book, till you know
a good many letters, you can understand
the cards, and you <i>notice</i> the letters on
them; and when you play with them you
will remember a great many letters on
them, and thus you will become more
familiar with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With what?&#8221; said Rollo.</p>

<p>&#8220;With the letters,&#8221; said his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is <i>familiar with them</i>?&#8221; asked
Rollo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why you will know them better, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
remember them longer,&mdash;and you will
know them quicker when you see them
again in books. That is being familiar
with them. Do you not think you will
like this box of cards a great deal better
now, to play with, than before you knew
any letters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, I was very glad to see the
A B C on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this Rollo played a great deal
with his cards, and though he did not learn
any new letters from them, they helped
him to become <i>familiar</i> with the letters
as fast as he learned them from his book.</p>

<p>The last part of the alphabet Rollo
learned very fast, and at length one evening
Mary and Rollo came together to their
father, telling him with smiling faces that
he had learned them all.</p>

<p>Then Rollo&#8217;s father gave him a long
lesson in reading little words&mdash;he gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
him a great many columns, so many, that
it would take a good many weeks to read
them all. Mary was to hear him four
times every day. Then he read the easy
sentences over in the end of his book, and
a good many others in another book, until
at last he could read very well alone. It
took a long time, however, to do all this
reading. When he finished learning to
read he was more than a year older than
he was when he began. The stories in
this book are for him to read, so that he
may learn to read better. You can read
them too. Farther on in this book I shall
tell you more about Rollo.</p>

<p>In reading these stories Rollo found a
great many words which he could not
understand. He always asked some one
what these words meant, for he wanted
to understand what he read perfectly.
His father advised him to read his story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
book aloud too, unless when it would disturb
some one, because by reading aloud
he would learn faster.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">
THE FIRST LESSONS IN LOOKING.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the baby was very little indeed,
and first began to open his eyes, his
mother saw that the bright light of the
windows dazzled them, and gave him
pain; so she shut the blinds and put
down the curtains.</p>

<p>When the baby was so very little, he
did not know how to look about at the
things which were around him. He had
not learned to move his eyes steadily from
one thing to another. He could not take
hold of any thing, either, with his hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
He did not know that his hands were
made to take hold of things with. His
mother held a handsome ivory ring before
him, and endeavored to make him see it
and take it. She put it in his hand, but
he did not know how to hold it, and it
dropped upon the floor.</p>

<p>The baby was very weak too. He
could not walk nor sit up, nor even hold
up his head. Unless his mother held his
head for him, it would drop down and
hang upon his shoulder. Once she laid
him down upon the bed, and she went
away a minute or two. While she was
gone he rolled over on his face, and was
so weak that he could not get back again.
I do not think he knew how to try. His
mother came back and lifted him up, or
perhaps he would have been stifled.</p>

<p>One day his mother said, &#8220;Oh, how
many things I have got to teach my little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
child. I must teach him to look, and to
hold up his head, and to take things in
his hands, and I must do all these things
while he is quite a little baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>She thought she would first teach him
<i>to look</i>. So she let in a little light, and
when he was quiet and still, she held him
so that he could see it. But he did not
seem to notice it, and pretty soon he went
to sleep.</p>

<p>The next day she tried it again; and
again on the following day; and soon she
found that he would look very steadily at
the white curtain, or at the place where
the sun shone upon the wall. She did
not yet try to make him look at <i>little
things</i>, for she knew she could not hope
to make him see little things till he had
learned to notice something large and
bright.</p>

<p>When Samuel was lying in his mother&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
lap, looking steadily at something;
she was always careful not to move him,
or to make any noise, or to do any thing
which would distract his attention. She
knew that children were always puzzled
with having two things to think of at a
time, and she was afraid that if while he
was thinking of the light and trying to
look at it, he should hear voices around
him, he would stop thinking of the light,
and begin to wonder what that noise
could be.</p>

<p>In about a week, Samuel had learned
his lesson very well. He could look
pretty steadily at a large bright spot
when it was still. Then his mother
thought she would try to teach him to
look at something smaller. She therefore
asked his father to buy her a large
bright orange, and one day when he was
lying quietly in her lap, she held it up before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
him. But he would not notice it;
he seemed to be looking at the window
beyond.</p>

<p>Then his mother turned her chair gently
round, and sat with her back towards
the window so that he could not see the
window, and then he looked at the orange.
Presently she moved the orange slowly,&mdash;very
slowly,&mdash;backwards and forwards,
to teach him to follow it with his eyes.
Thus the baby took his first lessons in
looking.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TICK,&mdash;TICK,&mdash;TICK.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> morning I was going to take a
journey. I was going in the stage. I
expected that the sleigh bells would come
jingling up to the door for me at seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
o&#8217;clock. So I thought that if I wished to
be ready, I must get up at <i>six</i>.</p>

<p>I went into my little room where I was
to sleep. There was a clock on the wall,
by the side of my bed. It said tick,&mdash;tick,&mdash;tick.
&#8220;I am glad,&#8221; said I to myself,
&#8220;for now I can see what o&#8217;clock it is.&#8221; So
I put my lamp down on the floor, and put
my spectacles behind my pillow, and then
laid down and went to sleep.</p>

<p>By and by I woke and thought I heard
a little noise. I listened. It was the
clock, saying tick,&mdash;tick,&mdash;tick; and I said
to myself, &#8220;I wonder what o&#8217;clock it is?&#8221;
So I sat up, and took my spectacles from
behind my pillow, and put them on my
nose, and looked up at the clock. The
lamp which was on the floor shone upon
the clock so that I could see, and I saw
that it was only <i>three</i> o&#8217;clock, and I said,
&#8220;Oh, it is only three o&#8217;clock. It is not time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
for me to get up yet.&#8221; So I took my
spectacles off of my nose, and put them
behind my pillow, and laid me down again.
The clock kept saying, tick,&mdash;tick,&mdash;tick.</p>

<p>Pretty soon I went to sleep, and I slept
an hour. Then I awoke and said to myself,
&#8220;I wonder what o&#8217;clock it is?&#8221; So I
sat up, and took my spectacles from behind
my pillow, and put them on my
nose, and looked up at the clock. The
lamp which was upon the floor shone
upon the clock, so that I could see, and I
saw that it was only <i>four</i> o&#8217;clock, and I
said, &#8220;Oh, it is only four o&#8217;clock; it is
not time for me to get up yet.&#8221; So I
took my spectacles off of my nose, and
put them behind my pillow, and laid me
down again. The clock kept saying all
the while, tick,&mdash;tick,&mdash;tick.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, I went to sleep, and slept
some time. Then I woke, and said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
myself, &#8220;I wonder what o&#8217;clock it is?&#8221;
So I sat up, and took my spectacles from
behind my pillow, and put them on my
nose, and looked up at the clock. The
lamp which was upon the floor shone
upon the clock, so that I could see, and I
saw that it was only <i>five</i> o&#8217;clock, and I
said, &#8220;Oh, it is only five o&#8217;clock. It is not
time for me to get up yet.&#8221; So I took
my spectacles off of my nose, and put
them behind my pillow, and laid me down
again. The clock kept saying all the
while, tick,&mdash;tick,&mdash;tick.</p>

<p>Pretty soon I went to sleep, and slept
some time. When I woke, I said to myself,
&#8220;I wonder what o&#8217;clock it is?&#8221; So
I sat up, and took my spectacles from behind
my pillow, and put them on my
nose, and looked up at the clock. The

saw that it was <i>six</i> o&#8217;clock. Then I said
<i>now</i> it is time for me to get up. So I
jumped up and dressed me, and looked
out of the window, and there was a beautiful,
bright star shining in the sky. The
star was up before me.</p>

<p>When I was ready I opened the door
to go out; but the clock still kept saying
tick,&mdash;tick,&mdash;tick. I wondered what made
the clock keep going so all the night and
all the day, and I went back and opened
the door to see. And what do you think
I found? Why, I found a great heavy
weight hung to a string, and the string
was fastened to some of the little wheels
up in the clock. The weight kept pulling
down and pulling down all the time, slowly,
and it pulled the string down slowly,
and the string made the wheels go round,
and the wheels made the hands go, and
some of the little wheels made that noise
I heard,&mdash;tick,&mdash;tick,&mdash;tick.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>What do you think happens when the
weights which make the clock go get
down, down, to the very bottom of the
clock? Why, then they have to wind
them up to the top again, and they begin
anew.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">JONAS.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> fine summer evening a gentleman
came riding down a hill in a country covered
with pleasant farm houses, green
fields, and little groups of trees. He had
a small boy in the wagon with him.</p>

<p>There was a brook at the bottom of
the hill. A bridge was built over the
brook, and the road passed over the
bridge. The horse and waggon, with the
gentleman and his boy in it, went swiftly
over the bridge and up the hill; but just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
as they began to ascend, one of the <i>traces</i>
broke.</p>

<p>One of the <i>traces</i>? What is a trace?
Do you know my boy? The traces are
those long, stout straps of leather which
pass along the sides of the horse, and are
fastened to the waggon. The horse draws
a waggon, or a chaise, by means of the
traces. Therefore they are always made
very strong. You can see a picture of
some traces in &#8220;Rollo learning to Talk,&#8221;
a book about as large as this, at the story of
a Goat for a Horse. The next time you
take a ride, I advise you to look at the
traces on the horse, and see how strong
they are. See too how they are fastened
to the horse, and how they are fastened
to the chaise.</p>

<p>If one of the traces should give way,
that is, should break, in going up a hill,
what do you think would be the consequence?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Why, the waggon would go
back, partly held by the other trace. That
was the way with this waggon; it went
back, the horse was frightened, the gentleman
jumped out, the boy called out,
&#8220;whoa,&mdash;<i>whoa</i>,&mdash;<small>WHOA</small>.&#8221;</p>

<p>It did not do any good. Boys had better
be still when there is any difficulty.</p>

<p>The waggon backed until, just as it
was going off the bank, a boy ran up and
put a stone behind the wheel. That
stopped it.</p>

<p>This was not the boy who was in the
waggon. It was another boy. The gentleman
had not seen him before. He had
on light colored clothes, a patched jacket,
and an old straw hat; one side of the brim
was almost worn out with catching butterflies;
the knees of his trousers were
stained with the grass. The gentleman
looked at him a minute, and said &#8220;thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
you, my boy.&#8221; Then he began to look at
the harness. When the gentleman had
examined the traces, he found that the
leather was not broken; it was only the
tongue of a buckle by which the trace
was fastened that was gone; for the harness
was new, and the waggon was a
handsome one.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I had a piece of twine to fasten
it with, till we get home,&#8221; said he to
his son, as he felt in his pockets. He
then looked around to see where the little
fellow was who had <i>trigged</i> the wheel.
Do you know what I mean by trigging
the wheel? The boy was sitting on the
trunk of a tree, by the side of the road,
and as the gentleman turned around to see
him, he was just pulling out a long piece
of twine from his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a string, sir,&#8221; said he; and he
got up and came to the gentleman. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
seemed tired however, for he went back
and sat down again immediately.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but I am
afraid it is not strong enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can double and twist it,&#8221; said
the boy.</p>

<p>They twisted the string, and then
doubled it and twisted it again, and so
tied the harness. The gentleman and
his son then got into the waggon again,
and were going to ride up the hill. The
gentleman hesitated a moment whether
he ought to offer to pay the boy for his
string or not. Do you think he ought
to?</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>would</i> pay him,&#8221; whispered his little
son; &#8220;he looks like a poor boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied his father,&#8220;but perhaps
he would make a bad use of the money.
Perhaps his father and mother would not
like to have him have any money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why cannot you ask him?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>The gentleman then turned to the boy
who was still sitting on the log, and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name, my little fellow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jonas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you live?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy hesitated a moment as if he
did not understand him. Then he said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know sir.&mdash;I don&#8217;t live any
where.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little boy in the waggon laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know where you live?&#8221; said
the gentleman. &#8220;Well, what are you doing
out here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been catching butterflies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know sir.&mdash;I came from the
city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The city! What city?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know sir,&mdash;the city back there.
I don&#8217;t know what the name of it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, I am not going to live there
any more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do your father and mother live
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father is dead; and I have not
got any mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has become of your mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never had any, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gentleman smiled a moment when
he heard this answer, and then he looked
serious and concerned and paused a moment.
He seemed not to know what to
do.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Jonas,&#8221; said he again, &#8220;you say
you do not live any where; where do
you get your food and sleep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you sleep at night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I slept in Mr. Williams&#8217; shed last
night.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>&#8220;And where do you expect to sleep to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get your breakfast
this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man gave me some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where did you get your dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not had any dinner, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No dinner!&mdash;I should think you
would be too tired and hungry to chase
butterflies, without any dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was too tired, and so I stopped.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gentleman, after talking with the
boy a little longer, concluded to take him
into his waggon, and carry him home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jump up behind into my waggon,
Jonas,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and I will give you
some supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Jonas jumped up behind and rode
home with them. You will hear more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
about him hereafter, for who do you think
this gentleman was? Why it was Rollo&#8217;s
father, and the boy who was riding with
him was Rollo himself. Jonas lived with
Rollo a long time, and became a very industrious,
useful boy. He used to take
care of Rollo, and play with him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">
A LITTLE LETTER.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a letter written to a little boy
about as large as you. James is the name
of the boy. James&#8217; uncle wrote it.</p>


<p>The letter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Dear James,</p>

<p>Do you want me to write you a
little letter about a robin? I think you
do. Well; I will write it. Now I will
begin. A robin is a bird. A robin has
two wings and two legs; he flies in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
air; it is his wings make him go. When
he comes down to the ground, he hops
along on his two legs. When he sees
a worm he picks it up with his bill. Do
you know what his <i>bill</i> is? It is a
mouth. Then he picks it up just as the
hen does, and eats it. Now for the story.</p>

<p>Near the house where I live, there is a
field; and in the field there is a tree. I
was walking in the field, and went near
the tree; as I went near it, a bird darted
out of the tree, and sung out very loud;
it made me start. When I saw it was a
bird, I looked among the leaves and
branches of the tree, and found there a
pretty robin&#8217;s nest, and three eggs. Only
think, a beautiful nest, with three eggs. I
looked at them for a minute, and then
went away and left them there. The
next day, I walked down to the tree
again, to see the nest and the pretty eggs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
I pulled away the leaves, but the nest was
not there. I stooped down on the ground,
looked into the grass, and there I saw the
robin. The poor robin was dead, the nest
was torn in pieces, and the eggs were
broken. I would send you one of the
eggs, but it is broken so much, that I
think it will not do. When the little robin
was alive, he sung pleasantly, he made
him a nest, and handsome eggs; but now
the robin is dead, the nest is torn in
pieces, and the eggs are broken. Poor
robin; poor robin.</p>

<p>I have written this story of the robin
for little James. I am very sorry that
any boy should kill the poor robin and
spoil its nest.</p>

<p>This is from your affectionate,</p>

<p class="right">Uncle.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2 class="nobreak">
ROLLO&#8217;S DREAM.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day Rollo&#8217;s mother wanted him
to do some errands for her. He went on
one, reluctantly, but when she gave him
another he murmured aloud. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;I wish I did not have so many errands
to do. What a hard life I lead!&#8221;</p>

<p>This gave his mother pain, and he saw
it. When he got back from this errand
she told him there was nothing more for
him to do. Rollo went and stood at the
door a few minutes to see if there were
any boys out there. But there were none,
so he took a story-book in his hand and
went down into the garden, and took his
seat in the little arbor which his father had
made for him, and began to read.</p>



<p>The arbor reminded him of his parents&#8217;
kindness, and this made him feel unhappy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to think of his unwillingness to help his
mother. These thoughts troubled him,
and so he could not attend to his book.
Presently he got lost in a reverie,&mdash;his
book dropped over upon his lap. His
head gradually sunk down,&mdash;and here
you see Rollo fast asleep.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p045.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">ROLLO ASLEEP IN THE ARBOR.&mdash;Page 46.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>While he slept he dreamed. Rollo
dreamed that he lived in a small house, a
great many miles away, and that his mother
was there alone with him. She asked
him one day to go and get a pail of water.
&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I wish I did not have so
much water to bring,&mdash;what a hard life I
lead!&#8221;</p>

<p>He dreamed that just then he saw a cat
lying down in the sun by the door. She
seemed to have nothing to do. &#8220;Oh,&#8221;
thought Rollo, &#8220;how I wish I were a cat.
It would be such a <i>fine thing</i> to be a cat.&#8221;</p>

<p>No sooner had he said this than he felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
some how or other a strong desire to get
down on his hands and knees,&mdash;he found
himself growing smaller and smaller,&mdash;his
fingers became sharp claws, and in
short Rollo dreamed that he was turning
into a cat.</p>

<p>He walked about, a minute or two,
stretched himself, mewed and purred to
ascertain that he was really a cat, and then
laid down again in the sun to go to sleep.
As he shut his eyes he said to himself,
purring, &#8220;How glad I am that I have no
more water to bring! What a fine thing
it is to be a cat!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pretty soon he waked up and was
hungry. His first thought was to go to
his mother as usual, for some bread and
butter. He went in and looked piteously
up into his mother&#8217;s face and mewed.
She did not mind him. He mewed louder.
She paid no attention. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
went to making a louder noise, as cats can,
when necessary. His mother went and
opened the door, and took the brush and
drove him out, saying as he went, &#8220;<i>scat</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rollo then thought he must go and
catch some mice or starve. So he went
down cellar, and posted himself before a
little hole in the wall. He waited here
an hour, and at length a little mouse
peeped out. Rollo darted his paw out at
him, but he missed him, and the mouse
drew back into his hole where he was
safe. Rollo waited many hours longer,
but no mouse came. &#8220;This is worse
than bringing water,&#8221; thought he. &#8220;I
wish I <i>could</i> get something to eat. What
a hard life I lead!&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then he heard, that is, he dreamed
he heard, a loud noise, moo-o-o, in the
yard. He scampered up, hungry as he
was, to see what was the matter. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the cow lowing to be milked. She looked
full and large, as if she had had as much
as she could eat.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the green fields all day,&#8221; thought
hungry Rollo, &#8220;with nothing to do but
eat and drink and then lie down under
the trees. Oh, how I wish I were a cow!&#8221;</p>

<p>He had no sooner said these words
than he found himself growing very large.
He felt something coming out of his forehead,&mdash;he
put his paw up, though with
difficulty, for his paw was growing into a
large, stiff leg, and he found that horns
were coming. By the time his leg was
down again, it was changed entirely, and
had a hoof at the end. He was becoming
a cow. He lashed his sides with his tail,
and walked about eating the grass in the
yard, till he had satisfied his hunger, and
then he said to himself, &#8220;How much
better this is than watching for mice all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
day in a dark cellar. Oh, it is a fine thing
to be a cow.&#8221;</p>

<p>After milking, they led Rollo into the
barn, put a halter round his neck, and tied
him in a dark, unpleasant stall. &#8220;Have
I got to stay tied up here till morning?&#8221;
thought Rollo. It was even so.</p>

<p>The next morning they drove him off
to pasture. The boy beat him with a
stick on the way, but he was so great and
clumsy that he could neither escape nor
defend himself. In the field, the flies bit
and stung him, and though he could brush
off some of them with his tail, yet the
largest and worst of them always seemed
to get upon places he could not reach.
At night when he was coming home, some
boys set a dog upon him and worried
him till he was weary of his life. &#8220;Ah,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;it is a terrible thing to be a
cow,&mdash;what a hard life I lead!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>Just then the dog became tired of
barking at him, and trotted away. &#8220;Oh,&#8221;
said Rollo, &#8220;if I was only a dog. A dog
can defend himself. Then a dog has
plenty to eat and nothing to do. What a
fine thing it would be to be a dog!&#8221; No
sooner said than done. Rollo began to
grow slender and small, his horns dropped
off,&mdash;his hoofs turned back into claws
again, his back became sleek and shining,
and he found himself a beautiful, black
dog, with hanging ears and a curled tail,
and an elegant brass collar about his neck.</p>

<p>Rollo ran about the streets very happily
for half an hour, and then went home.
The dream seemed to change its scene
here, and Rollo found himself in a beautiful
yard belonging to the house where his
master lived. He went home hungry,
and they gave him a bone to eat.
&#8220;What,&#8221; said Rollo to himself, &#8220;nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
but a bone!&#8221; He gnawed it for a while,
thinking, however, that it was rather hard
fare, and then began to think of going to
bed. There was no bed for him, however;
for his master came and took hold
of his collar, and led him along towards a
post in the yard, where he chained him,
and throwing his bone down by his side,
left him to watch for the thieves.</p>

<p>Rollo had a bad night. &#8217;Tis true no
thieves came, but he was all the time
afraid they would come, and at every little
noise he woke up and growled. Thus
disturbed, and chilled by the cool air of
the night, he passed his hours restlessly
and miserably. &#8220;Ah!&#8221; said he, &#8220;dogs
do not have so pleasant a life as I supposed.
What a hard way this is to get a
living!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment he heard a great many
persons coming along; he started up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
barked, for it was very early, though beginning
to be light. A number of men
were leading a huge animal along. It
was an elephant. They were taking him
into town for a show, and they came in
early, so that nobody should see him without
paying.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the life for me,&#8221; said Rollo.
&#8220;What a gentleman of an animal the elephant
is; he has a dozen men to wait
upon him. Ha! Old Longnose, what a
happy fellow you must be. Oh, if I was
only an elephant!&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as he had said this, he could
feel his nose lengthening into a slender
trunk,&mdash;his body swelled out to a great
size,&mdash;his feet grew large, and his black,
shining skin turned into a coarse, rough,
grey hide,&mdash;and he found himself walking
along the road, with a man on his head.</p>

<p>He arrived at the great stable where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
was to be exhibited, thinking that it was
an admirable thing to be an elephant.
They gave him something to eat, and soon
the men and boys came in to see him.
For half an hour he had a fine time, walking
around, carrying boys about on his
tusks,&mdash;taking his keeper&#8217;s head into his
mouth,&mdash;picking up nuts and pieces of
gingerbread with the finger and thumb at
the end of his proboscis,&mdash;laying down
and rising again at the keeper&#8217;s command.
Pretty soon, however, he got tired, and
when the keeper ordered him to lay
down, he concluded that he would not get
up again. But the keeper taught him by
blows that he was not his own master, if
he was a gentleman. New troops of
starers kept coming in, and Rollo got tired
out completely with going over and over
again the same evolutions. He could
hardly stand at last, and when they left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
him for the night, and he lay down to try
to rest, and he reflected that it must be
just so to-morrow, and the next day, and
so on as long as he lived, he was almost
in despair. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; said he, how foolish I
was to wish to be an elephant! I had
rather be any thing else. What a hard
life I lead!</p>

<p>&#8220;And then such a window as this to
look out of, after my hard day&#8217;s work,&#8221;
said he, as he turned his eye upward towards
a little square hole in the stable
wall. &#8220;What a window for an elephant&#8217;s
residence!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he looked out this hole, his eye rested
upon a green tree growing in a garden
behind the wall. A bird was perched
upon a branch, singing an evening song.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you little bird, what a happy
time you must have there,&mdash;free as air,
and full of happiness. You find plenty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
eat, you have your own pleasant home upon
a lofty tree, out of the reach of any danger.
You go where you please with your swift
wings. Oh, if I only had wings, how easily
I could escape from all my troubles.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he said this, his long proboscis which
was lying over his leg as he was reclining
upon the stable floor, began to straighten
out and stiffen,&mdash;turning into a huge bill,&mdash;feathers
began to come out all over
him&mdash;his immense body dwindled down
to the size of an ox, then to that of a sheep,
and finally he became smaller than a
dove. Beautiful wings covered his sides.
He hopped along upon the floor, and finding
that he was really a bird, he leaped
up and flew out of the window,&mdash;away
from the ugly stable forever.</p>

<p>He spent a pleasant night among the
trees, and early the next morning was
singing blithely upon a branch. A man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
came into the field with something in his
hand. Rollo looked at him, happy to
think that no man could catch him or hurt
him, now that he had such a pair of wings.
In a minute the man held up the thing he
had in his hands and pointed at him. Rollo
had just time to see that it was a gun,
and to stretch his wings in terrible fear,
when,&mdash;<i>flash</i>,&mdash;<small>BANG</small>,&mdash;went the gun, and
down came the poor bird to the ground,
with his wing and leg torn away, and a
dozen leaden shot lodged in his red
breast,&mdash;for he was a robin. The terror
and pain waked him up, and he found himself
sitting in his arbor, with his book on
the ground, where it had fallen from his
hand. He got up, and went to the house,
thinking that a discontented mind would
find trouble enough in any situation, and
that a boy with kind parents, a pleasant
home, and plenty of food and clothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
ought not to complain of his lot, even if
he was called upon sometimes to help his
mother.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">THE COLD MORNING.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> pleasant morning in the fall of the
year, little Charles, who had been sleeping
on the trundle-bed in his mother&#8217;s
chamber, waked up and opened his eyes.
He looked around him, and saw that his
father was dressing himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said he, &#8220;may I get up
too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is pretty cold this morning; can you
bear the cold long enough to dress yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, father, I need not stay here; I
can take up my clothes and run down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
into the parlor, and dress me there by the
fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it is not proper for any body to
go to the parlor till they are dressed. Besides,
perhaps the fire is not built yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time, Charles&#8217; nose had become
pretty cold; so he said, &#8220;Well, I believe
I will wait;&#8221; and he drew his head under
the bedclothes again.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he became warm
again, and thought that it would not be
very cold if he should get up, and that if
it was, he should not mind it. He looked
out a second time, and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, do you think I should have
time to dress me before you get ready to
go down stairs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you will, if you are quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I could help you any
in building the fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you might hand me the wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and carry out the ashes, and after the
fire is built, you might sweep up the
hearth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will get up,&#8221; said Charles; and
he sprang out of bed, and began to dress
himself.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, however, he began
to be cold, and to shiver, and his fingers
grew numb, and he began to wish he had
waited a little longer. At last he stopped
dressing himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it is colder than I
thought it was. I have a great mind to
get into bed again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said his father, &#8220;you can do
as you please; but how far have you got,
in dressing yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am about half dressed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it will take you about as long to
undress again as it would to finish dressing,
and be ready to go down.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>Charles stood a moment shivering and
thinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it will,&#8221; said he; &#8220;I wish I had
not put on my jacket.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a moment&#8217;s pause, he concluded
to finish dressing, and he went on resolutely
through it; and just as his father
opened the door, he took hold of his hand,
saying that he was ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said he, as they were going
down stairs, &#8220;I think that when any body
means to do any thing, he ought to think
of all the difficulties before he begins, and
then go through it quickly without stopping.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; said his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I grew colder while I was
standing still, not knowing what to do,
than all the time while I was dressing me.
And now I shall be very cold before we
get the fire built. Father, I don&#8217;t see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
what makes it cold. I wish it was always
warm as it is in summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;While we are building the fire, I will
explain it to you,&#8221; said his father. So
they went down stairs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Rollo read this story he said he
was sorry it left off without telling why
it is colder in the winter than in the summer,
because he thought he should like to
know. So at breakfast that morning, he
asked his father to explain it to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said his father, &#8220;I will explain
it to you. It is because in the winter the
sun moves through such a part of the sky
that he does not shine so well upon the
part of the world which we live in, as he
does in the summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rollo listened attentively to what his
father said, but he thought he did not understand
it very well. So he said he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
meant always to dress himself quick in
the cold morning, and not keep beginning
and leaving off as Charles did.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">HOW TO READ RIGHT.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">I wish</span> all the boys and girls who may
read this book to learn by it to read right,
and now I shall tell you how to read right.
But first I must explain some things to
you about the way in which books are
printed. What I am going to tell you
now, is what Rollo&#8217;s father explained to
him, after he had learned to read in easy
reading, and had learned all the stops,&mdash;the
comma, and the period, and the interrogation
mark, and all the stops. I shall
explain them to you by the help of a story,
which I am going to put in here. I shall
stop telling the story every few minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to explain some things about the way of
printing it. Here is the beginning of the
story:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><small>Once there was a man who thought he would go up
upon a mountain.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>That is the beginning of the story; but
I wish to stop a moment to ask you to
look at the letters which it is printed with,
and see whether they are as large as the
reading before it. Is it printed in just as
large letters, or larger, or smaller? Yes,
it is smaller. I am going to have all the
story printed in smaller print. The reason
is because the principal thing I wish
to do now, is to explain to you how to
read, and I only wish for the story to help
me,&mdash;so I put it in smaller print, or as
they generally call it smaller <i>type</i>. It is
very often so in books. One part is
printed in larger, and the other part in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
smaller type. The most important is in
large type. The least important is in
small type. If you will ask your father or
mother, or your brother or sister, if you
have one old enough, they will show you
books with large and small print in them.
Whenever you see any thing printed in
smaller print than the rest of the book, you
ought not to read right on without thinking
any thing of it; but you ought to pause
a minute, and observe it, and think what
the reason is. Now I will begin my story
again in small print.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><small>Once there was a man who thought he would go up
upon a mountain; so he rode along on his horse till he
came as near to the mountain as he could, in the road,&mdash;and
then he turned off into the woods and rode on until
he came to the foot of the mountain. He could ride no
farther; so he tied his horse to a tree.</small></p>

<p><small>Then he began to walk up the mountain.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>Do you see that when we come to the
word <i>tree</i>, just above there, that we leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
off printing in that line. There is a
period, and then the rest of the line has
nothing in it. It is blank, as they call it,
that is white, all white paper. The next
part of the story begins in the next line.
The next part of the story is, these words,
&#8220;Then he began,&#8221; and that is printed in
the next line. And if you look at it, you
will see that it is not exactly at the beginning
of the line. The word &#8220;Then&#8221; is
not printed as near the side of the page as
the other lines above it are. There is a
little space left blank. Do you see the
little space left blank before the &#8220;Then&#8221;?
Now what do you suppose is the reason
why we left off in the middle of the line
and began again in the next line, leaving
a little blank space? Why, it is because I
had finished telling you all about the
man&#8217;s <i>coming to</i> the mountain, and was
now going to tell you about his <i>going up</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the mountain, and so I thought it would
be best to leave off for that line, and begin
again in the next. Should you like to
know what such a place is called? It is
called a new paragraph. A new paragraph
is made whenever we come to any
new part of the story. If you look back
over the leaves of this book you will find
a great many new paragraphs on all the
pages. If any person says any thing in
the story, we put what he says in a paragraph
by itself. See if you can find some
new paragraphs.</p>

<p>Now, when you come to any new
paragraph in your reading, you ought not
to read right forward without stopping or
noticing it at all. You should pause a
little when one paragraph ends, and then
begin again when the new paragraph begins,
so that those who hear you read, and
who are not looking over, may know by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the sound of your voice, that you have
come to a new paragraph.</p>

<p>Now I will go on with the story, again,
beginning at the new paragraph.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><small>Then he began to walk up. He scrambled through
the bushes for some time, and at last came out into a
smooth, but muddy path. Here, however, he was in no
little difficulty, for the path was so slippery that notwithstanding
all he could do, he seemed rather to be sliding
<i>down</i>, than climbing up.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>Here we come to the end of another
paragraph. And I wish you to look at
the word &#8220;<i>down</i>&#8221; in the last line. Do
you see any thing strange about it? Is it
printed like the other words?</p>

<p>Once I asked some children to look at
a word printed so, and to tell me what
the difference was between it and other
words. One said it looked fainter. Another
said it looked smaller. A third said it
was not printed with good ink. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
true explanation is, the letters of the word
are slanting. That is all. It makes the
word look a little fainter.</p>

<p>You will see that the letters are different
by looking first at the d in &#8220;sliding,&#8221;
which comes before &#8220;<i>down</i>,&#8221; and then
looking at the <i>d</i> in &#8220;<i>down</i>.&#8221; The d in
&#8220;sliding&#8221; is straight. The <i>d</i> in &#8220;<i>down</i>&#8221; is
slanting; all the other letters in <i>down</i>
are slanting. Do you know what this
kind of printing is called? It is called
Italic.</p>

<p>The word &#8220;<i>down</i>&#8221; in the story is printed
in Italics. The reason why it is printed
in Italics is because I wanted you to
notice it particularly. It is remarkable
that while the man was trying to get <i>up</i>,
he should, instead of that, slide <i>down</i>. So
I had the word printed differently, that you
might notice it particularly. Whenever
you are reading and come to any word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
printed in Italics, you must notice it, and
speak it very distinctly, for it is an important
word.</p>

<p>Look back in this book and see if you
can find some words printed in Italics.
When you find one, read the sentence it
is in aloud, and speak the word which is
in Italics very plain and distinct, and see
if you do not understand the sentence
better.</p>

<p>You must always read such words very
distinctly in all books except the Bible.
In the Bible, the words are put in Italics
for a different reason, which I cannot explain
to you now. Now I will go on with
the story.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><small>He at last got over this slippery part of the path, and
then came to a place where it was very rocky. Trees and
bushes hung over his head, and grew thick all around
him, and he began to be afraid that he might meet some
wild beast. Presently he looked through the bushes, and
saw at a distance among the rocks, some large black thing,</small><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
<small>and he thought it was a bear. He was very much frightened,
and began to scream out as loud as he could, <span class="smcap">Help,
Help, Help</span>.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>Do you notice any thing remarkable in
those three last words? Are they printed
like the other words? Are they
printed in Italics? How do they differ
from common printing? Can you tell?
Do you often see words printed so?</p>

<p>They are printed in Capitals. Capitals
are letters shaped differently from other
letters. They are generally larger than
other letters, but not always. These
words are printed in capitals, because they
are very important indeed. The man
cried, Help, Help, Help, very loud. So
we print them in Capitals. If a word is
very important, we generally print it in
Italics, but if it is <i>very</i> important <i>indeed</i>
we print it in Capitals. When you come
to a word printed in Capitals, you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
generally read it very plain and distinctly
indeed. I should like to have you look
back to the story of Jonas, and see how
the words are printed where the boy said
&#8220;Whoa.&#8221; Can you tell the reason why
they are printed so? and can you read
them right? But let us go on with the
story.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><small>At the same time that he shouted for help so loud, he
grasped hold of a tree close by, and began to climb it, by
the branches, to get out of the bear&#8217;s way. When he got
up a little way, he could see over the bushes to the very
place where the bear was; he looked there, and saw&mdash;what
do you think it was?</small></p></blockquote>

<p>You see a straight mark printed after
&#8220;saw.&#8221; Do you see it? What do you suppose
it is? It is what they call a <i>dash</i>.
The reason why I put the dash there, is
that I was going to tell you what the man
saw, but I suddenly stopped, and asked
you what you thought it was. When we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
suddenly stop in saying any thing, and
begin to say something else, we put in a
<i>dash</i>. So we use a dash in some other
ways. You ought to stop a little when
you come to a dash, thus; &#8220;He looked
there and saw&mdash;what do you think it
was?&#8221; Dashes are generally put in, when
we want you to stop a little in your reading.
Now for the story again.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><small>He looked, and saw&mdash;what do you think it was? Why,
it was nothing but an old, black log!!</small></p></blockquote>

<p>Do you see two characters at the end
of that sentence? They are notes of exclamation.
When two of them are put
together they mean that what comes before
them is very extraordinary and surprising.
Should you not think it was very
extraordinary and surprising for a man to
think he saw a bear, and be frightened
and shout help, and climb up into a tree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and find, after all, that it was nothing but
a great, black log? It is surprising, and
when you read it, you must read it as if
you thought it was very surprising, so;
&#8220;What do you think it was? Why it
was nothing but an old, black log!!&#8221; You
can get your father or mother to show
you how to read it, if you do not know.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><small>It was nothing but an old, black log, lying against the
rocks. The man felt ashamed. He clambered down, and
went to look at the log which had frightened him so. It
was as black as a coal.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">*</a> The man laughed to think that
he should have supposed <i>that</i> to be a bear.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>Do you see after the word <i>coal</i>, in the
last line but one, a little star? Do you
know what that star is for? It is to make
you look down to the bottom of the page,
and there you will find something more
about the black wood. When you come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to any little star then, when you are reading,
you must look down to the bottom
of the page, and there you will find another
little star, with something printed
after it. That which is printed thus at the
bottom of a page is called a <i>note</i>.</p>

<p>Other characters besides stars are made
for notes. These are some of the characters,
§ ¶ &#8224; &#8225;. There are not many notes
in this book. Perhaps you will find some
by and by.</p>



<p>This is all that I have to tell you now
about reading. But now I will put in the
whole story about the man going up the
mountain, and you may see if you can
read it all right, and see too, if you remember
all that I have explained.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

CLIMBING UP A MOUNTAIN.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> there was a man who thought
he would go up upon a mountain; so he
rode along upon his horse till he came as
near the mountain as he could, and then
he turned off into the woods and rode on
until he came to the foot of the mountain.
He could ride no farther; so he tied his
horse to a tree.</p>

<p>Then he began to walk up. He
scrambled through the bushes for some
time, and at last came out into a smooth
but muddy path. Here, however, he was
in no little difficulty, for the path was so
slippery that, notwithstanding all he could
do, he seemed rather to be sliding <i>down</i>,
than climbing <i>up</i>.</p>

<p>He at last got over this slippery part
of the path, and then came to a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
where it was very rocky. Trees and
bushes hung over his head, and grew thick,
all around him, and he began to be afraid
that he might meet with some wild beast.
Presently he looked through the bushes,
and saw at a distance among the rocks,
some large, black thing, and he thought it
was a bear. He was very much frightened,
and began to scream out as loud as
he could, <span class="smcap">Help, Help, Help</span>.</p>

<p>At the same time that he shouted for
help so loud, he grasped hold of a tree
close by, and began to climb it, by the
branches, to get out of the bear&#8217;s way.
When he got up a little way he could see
over the bushes to the very place where
the bear was; he looked there and saw,&mdash;what
do you think it was? Why it
was nothing but <i>an old, black log</i>! An
old, black log, lying against the rocks. The
man felt ashamed. He clambered down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and went to look at the log which had
frightened him so. It was as black as a
coal.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">*</a> The man laughed to think that he
should have supposed <i>that</i> to be a bear.</p>

<p>He determined not to be so foolish
another time, and then he went along
climbing up the mountain. It was steep
and rocky, and there were bushes and
trees each side of the path. He had to
stop often to take breath and rest himself.
At last he reached the top, and
could see a great many miles all around.
He could see woods and farms and towns
and rivers away down, down, very far
below him.</p>

<p>After a while he came down the mountain.
He walked very carefully, so as not
to fall. When he came to where the old
black log was, he looked at it and laughed.</p>

ROLLO GETTING READY FOR HIS
FATHER.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day little Rollo was sitting by the
fire on his green cricket. His mother
was sewing at her work-table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said Rollo, &#8220;when do you
think father will come home?&#8221;</p>

<p>His mother said, &#8220;I think he will come
home pretty soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Rollo, &#8220;I think I had
better get a chair for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he went and took hold of the great
rocking-chair, to pull it to the fire for his
father; but it was so heavy that it would
not come. So Rollo began to cry.</p>

<p>His mother looked up and said, &#8220;Rollo,
what is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rollo said, &#8220;This rocking-chair will not
come.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>&#8220;Where do you want to carry it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want it to be by the fire, so that
my father can sit in it when he comes
home,&#8221; said Rollo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you want your father to
have it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because;&#8221; said he. He did not
know exactly how to tell the reason, and
so he only said &#8220;Because.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is because you wish to please him
and to save him trouble, is it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother,&#8221; said Rollo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, do you not think it displeases
me and gives me trouble to have you cry,
and make me get up and come and move
the chair for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rollo knew it did, but he did not answer.</p>

<p>Then his mother said, &#8220;What good
does it do to displease <i>me</i> and make <i>me</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
trouble, for the sake of pleasing <i>father</i>
and saving <i>him</i> trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rollo could not answer this question;
so he kept swinging and rocking, back
and forth, on the chair. His mother
went on with her work.</p>

<p>By and by he said, &#8220;Well, I can get
my father&#8217;s slippers for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he went to the little closet by the
side of the fire, and took out the slippers,
and put them down in the corner, and
then when his father came in, he ran to
the door to meet him, and he said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, father, I could not move up
your chair, but there are your slippers all
ready.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">
THE WAY TO OBEY.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Rollo was about five years old,
his mother one evening took him up in
her lap, and said,</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, Rollo, it is about time for you to
go to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, mamma,&#8221; said Rollo, &#8220;<i>must</i> I go
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you know,&#8221; said his mother,
&#8220;that it is wrong for you to say that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, mother,&#8221; said Rollo, surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I think it is time for you to go
to bed, it is wrong for you to say or do
any thing which shows that you are not
willing to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because that makes it more unpleasant
for you to go, and more unpleasant for
me to send you. Now whenever I think
that it is time for you to go, it is my duty
to send you, and it is your duty to go,
and we never ought to do any thing to
make our duty unpleasant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rollo then said nothing. He sat still a
few minutes thinking.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>&#8220;Do you understand it?&#8221; said his
mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother,&#8221; said Rollo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose now any mother should say
to her boy, &#8216;Come, my boy, it is time
for you to go to bed;&#8217; and the boy should
say, &#8216;I won&#8217;t go.&#8217; Would that be right
or wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, very wrong,&#8221; said Rollo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose he should begin to cry, and
say he did not want to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be very wrong too,&#8221; said
Rollo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose he should begin to beg a
little, and say, &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to go <i>now</i>,
I should think you might let me sit up a
little longer.&#8217; What should you think of
that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It would be wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose he should look up into his
mother&#8217;s face sorrowfully, and say, &#8216;<i>Must</i>
I go now, mother?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>&#8220;Wrong,&#8221;&mdash;said Rollo, faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose he should not say a word,
but look cross and ill-humored, and throw
away his playthings in a pet, and walk by
the side of his mother, reluctantly and
slowly. What should you think of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it would be wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose he should look pleasantly,
and say, &#8216;Well mother,&#8217; and come pleasantly
to take her hand, and bid the persons
in the room good night, and walk off
cheerfully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be right,&#8221; said Rollo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said his mother, &#8220;and always
when a child is told to do any thing,
whether it is pleasant to do or not, he
ought to obey at once, and cheerfully.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">
ROLLO&#8217;S BREAKFAST.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Rollo</span> was sitting one morning by the
fire-side, before breakfast, reading in a little
blue covered hymn-book. Presently
Mary brought in the breakfast; and Rollo
was glad, and jumped up from his little
<i>low</i> chair at the fire, and went and brought
his <i>high</i> chair, and put it at his place at
the table.</p>

<p>When they were all ready, they stood
still, while Rollo&#8217;s father said in a slow
and serious manner, &#8220;Almighty God, we
thank thee that thou hast again spread
this table for us, and prepared this food.
Help us now to receive it thankfully, and
may it strengthen us to obey thy commands
this day; we ask it for Christ&#8217;s
sake.&#8221; Then they sat down.</p>

<p>Rollo knew that this was called asking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
a blessing, and he had always been taught
to be very still, and very attentive, while
it was done. He did not know however,
exactly what it was for, and he thought
he would now ask his father.</p>

<p>His father told him it was to thank
God for their breakfast.</p>

<p>Rollo asked his father whether God
gave them their breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said his father, &#8220;God causes
our breakfast to be brought to us from
many distant places.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do the knives and forks come
from?&#8221; said Rollo.</p>

<p>&#8220;They come from England. The men
dig up the iron out of the ground to make
the blades, and take horn and make the
handles, and then roll them up in a paper
and put them in a ship. The ship brings
them across the ocean, more than a thousand
miles, to Boston. Then the waggoner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
puts them in his waggon, and brings
them over the hills and valleys away to
this town where we live,&mdash;all that little
Rollo may have a knife and fork to eat
his breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do the plates come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They come from England. The men
find a bank of white clay, and they mix
up some of it with water, until it is like
dough. Then they make it into the shape
of plates, and cups, and saucers, and paint
them blue; and put them into a large, hot
oven, and bake them hard. When they
are cooled, they pack them up in a sort of
a basket, large and square; and put straw
and hay between them, so that they need
not break. And so they bring them over
the waves, and over the hills, away to the
town we live in, so that little Rollo may
have a plate when he eats his breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where does the coffee come from?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>&#8220;It comes from Cuba. The negroes
plant a tree and take good care of it while
it grows, until there are a great many
kernels of coffee upon it. They gather
them when they are ripe, and sew them
up in a bag, and send them all the way
over the sea, and over the land, across the
rivers and mountains and rocks. When
they come here, Mary burns them brown,
and grinds them in the mill, and heats the
water, all that little Rollo may have some
coffee to drink for breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where does the bread come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When the summer begins, the little
green blades of wheat grow up out of the
ground, in the farmer&#8217;s fields. God waters
it with showers, and warms it with the
sun, so that it grows and grows and grows,
till it is higher than Rollo&#8217;s head. Then
the little grains of wheat grow in the top
of it, and when they are ripe, the farmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
cuts them down, and pounds them out
with a great heavy flail, and puts them
in a bag, and sends them to mill. At the
mill they are ground between two great
stones, into fine, white flour, and the baker
mixes the flour and water; and makes
the dough, and bakes it in his great hot
oven, all that little Rollo may have some
bread for breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, but father,&#8221; said Rollo, &#8220;how
does God give us our breakfast then?&#8221;</p>

<p>His father said, &#8220;Why, it is God who
made the iron in the ground for the knives,
and the clay for the plates and cups. He
brings the summer and the sun. He
makes the wheat sprout up and grow, and
brings the showers of rain. He takes
care too, of all the men who shape the
cups, and make the knives, and gather the
coffee, and grind the wheat. He does all
this kindly for us,&mdash;so that Rollo and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the other boys in the world may have
some breakfast. I think we ought to
thank him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rollo did not say any thing, but he
thought so too.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">FICTITIOUS STORIES.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;Father,</span> will you tell me a story?&#8221;
said Rollo one day.</p>

<p>Rollo&#8217;s father was sitting on the platform,
leading out to the garden-yard.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">*</a> It
was a pleasant summer evening, just before
sunset.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall it be a true story, or a <i>fictitious</i>
one?&#8221; said his father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>&#8220;What is fictitious?&#8221; asked Rollo.</p>

<p>&#8220;A story that is not true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it would be wrong for you to tell
me any thing that was not true, would it
not?&#8221; said Rollo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it would be certainly
wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you were coming along the
yard, and were riding on my cane, and
should come up to me and say, &#8216;Papa,
this is my horse. See what a noble horse
I have got.&#8217; Would that be wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it be true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&mdash;It would not be a real
horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now do you know why it would be
right in this case for you to say it was a
horse, when it was not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rollo could not tell.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>&#8220;I will tell you,&#8221; said his father. &#8220;Because
you would not be trying to <i>deceive</i>
me. I could see your horse, as you call
him, and could see that it was nothing
but a cane. You would not be trying to
deceive me, to make me think it was a
real horse when it was not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said Rollo.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you should say any thing which is
not strictly true, and want to make me
think it is true, that would be very wrong.
That would be telling a lie. So it would
be very wrong for me to tell you any thing
which is not true, and try to make you
think it is true. But it is not wrong for
me to make up a little story to amuse
you, if I do not try to deceive you by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would that be a fictitious story?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, father, I should like to have
you tell me a fictitious story.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>&#8220;Well, I will tell you one. The name
of it is, The Fly&#8217;s Morning Walk.&#8221; So
Rollo&#8217;s father took his little boy up in his
lap, and told him the following fictitious
story.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">*</span></a> They called it the garden-yard, because it led out to
the garden. You can see Jonas in the picture, wheeling
out a load of weeds, along the path from the garden to

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">THE FLY&#8217;S MORNING WALK.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> there was a little fly with broad,
thin wings and round body and two great
eyes. When he waked up in the morning,
he found he was standing on the wall,
and he thought he would go and find
something for breakfast.</p>

<p>He flew down upon the table, and then
crept along. First he found a little grain
of sand, and said he, &#8220;I wonder if this is
good to eat.&#8221; So he reached out his long
<i>proboscis</i> to it, and tried to taste of it, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
he found it was dry and rough and hard.
&#8220;Oh, <i>no, no, no</i>,&#8221; said he, &#8220;this is not
good to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he walked along a little farther,
and came to some dust. And he said,
&#8220;I wonder whether this is good to eat.&#8221;
So he reached out his long proboscis to it,
and tried to taste of it; but he found it
was dry and insipid, and it stuck all over
the end of his proboscis, and he said, &#8220;Oh,
<i>no, no, no</i>, this is not good to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he went along until he came to a
pin, and he said, &#8220;I wonder whether this
is good to eat.&#8221; So he reached out his long
proboscis, and tried to taste of it, but it
was smooth and hard and round, and he
could not taste of it at all. And he said,
&#8220;Oh, <i>no, no, no</i>, this is not good to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he went round to the point of the
pin, and he said, &#8220;I wonder whether this
is good to eat&#8221;; but as soon as he touched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
his long proboscis to it, it pricked the end
of it, and he started back and said, &#8220;Oh,
<i>no, no, no</i>, this is not good to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he went along a little further, and
came to a crack in the table, and he said,
&#8220;I wonder whether there is any thing
here good to eat.&#8221; So he reached down
his long proboscis into it, and got it pinched
in, so he cried out, &#8220;Oh, oh, oh, this is not
good to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he went along a little further, and
by this time he began to be very hungry,
and presently, he saw a very small thing
lying on the table, and he walked up to it,
and began to feel of it with his long proboscis,
and found it tasted very sweet and
good. It was a little piece of a sugar-dog,
which a boy had dropped there, and he
said, &#8220;Oh, <i>yes, yes, yes</i>, this is very good
to eat.&#8221; Thus at last the little fly found
some breakfast.</p>

<hr class="chap" />






<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>
<h2 class="nobreak">WAKING UP.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Rollo&#8217;s</span> father was a very kind father.
He took very good care of his little boy.
He had a little trundle-bed made for him
to sleep in, and good warm clothes for him
to wear, and besides he would very often
talk to him very kindly and pleasantly.</p>

<p>Once Rollo&#8217;s mother took cold and became
sick. Her sickness increased for
several days, until at last it became necessary
for her to have a nurse come and
take care of her.</p>

<p>That night Rollo was put to bed in
another chamber, and his father came to
hear him say his prayers, and to bid him
good night. He put his cheek down to
Rollo&#8217;s, and they both prayed, first one
and then the other, that God would take
care of them both, and forgive their sins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and give them good and holy hearts, and
prepare them for heaven.</p>

<p>Just before his father went away, he
said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Rollo, I am going to sleep here with
you to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you?&#8221; said Rollo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; the nurse is going to take care
of mother, and in an hour or two, I shall
come here and go to bed. Now when
the morning comes, if you will pull me,
and wake me up, I will tell you a little
story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Rollo, &#8220;I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then his father took up the light to go
away.</p>

<p>Rollo did not want to have the light
taken away, and he said, &#8220;Father, are
you going to carry away the light?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221; said his
father.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>&#8220;No, sir, I think I wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I think I must take the light
away, and you must shut up your eyes
and go to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Rollo laid his cheek upon the pillow,
and shut up his eyes, though they
quivered a little, because he was not
sleepy, and pretty soon his father went
away.</p>

<p>The next morning, little Rollo was
awakened by some one rubbing him,
and when he opened his eyes he found
that it was his father, whose face was
close to his upon the pillow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rollo,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I told you, last
night, that if you would pull me and wake
me up, this morning, I would tell you a
little story: but you kept asleep all this
time, so I had to pull you and rub you
and wake <i>you</i> up; was not that funny?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rollo smiled faintly, for he was not
yet quite awake.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>Pretty soon he opened his eyes wide,
and looked around the room. He saw
that the window-curtains were very light,
and he perceived that it was morning.
His father then put his face to his, and
said these words. He was praying to
Almighty God.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, God, thou hast been in this room
all night, watching and taking care of little
Rollo and me while we have been asleep.
We thank thee that thou hast kept us
safely. Wilt thou take care of us all the
day, and make us kind to all in the house.
Do not let Rollo be disobedient or obstinate
or ungrateful or unkind to little
Lucy; and make us all good and happy,
for Christ&#8217;s sake, Amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rollo was still and attentive while his
father said these words. He wanted God
to hear and do what his father asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rollo,&#8221; said his father, a few minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
afterwards, &#8220;what are you going to do all
day to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Rollo, &#8220;I am going to play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going to get your
breakfast?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am going to get it down stairs,
in the parlor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But whose breakfast is that down in
the parlor? Is it yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you buy it with your money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall you get it ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, I do not know how to get
the breakfast ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is not your breakfast; it is all
my breakfast; but as you have not got
any breakfast of your own, I believe I will
let you have some of my breakfast. But
what are you going to do for a house to
live in all day?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Rollo, &#8220;I am going to live
in this house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But is this your house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it yours? Did not you build
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did not you buy it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And haven&#8217;t you got any house to
live in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, not unless you let me live in
yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you have not any house to
live in, I will let you live in mine to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Rollo pointed up to the wall,
and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;See, there is a tiger on the wall;&mdash;it
looks like a tiger.&#8221;</p>

<p>His father looked up at the irregular
lines on the wall, which had attracted his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
little boy&#8217;s attention, but he could not see
any thing that resembled a tiger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see,&#8221; said his father; &#8220;where
is his <i>head</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has not got any head; it is not a
tiger, it only looks like a tiger. It has
got a tail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, where is his tail?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;don&#8217;t&mdash;know. I see a stag,
too, and camel.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a minute or two his father turned
Rollo&#8217;s face over gently towards himself,
so that his attention should not be attracted
by what he saw there. He wanted
him to listen to what he was saying to
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Rollo,&#8221; said he, &#8220;whose clothes
are you going to wear to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am going to wear <i>my</i> clothes,&#8221;
said Rollo; &#8220;yours would be a great deal
too big.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>&#8220;Have you got any clothes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;don&#8217;t&mdash;know,&#8221; said Rollo,
hesitating.</p>

<p>&#8220;The clothes which you wore yesterday
belong to <i>me</i>,&#8221; said his father. &#8220;Have
you got any others?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Rollo; &#8220;I have got
some up stairs in the drawer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, those belong to me. I paid for
them with my money, and I might sell
them or give them away at any time, if I
chose. Have you not got any others?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said Rollo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said his father, &#8220;I shall let you
wear those clothes of mine then. I am
very glad I have got a house, and some
breakfast, and some clothes for my little
Rollo boy since you have not got any of
your own. But I think if I get a house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
for you to live in, and breakfast for you
to eat, and clothes for you to wear, you
ought to be a very careful, faithful, obedient
little boy.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">ROLLO&#8217;S PRAYER.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> night, when Rollo went to bed, he
said a prayer which his father had taught
him. It is an excellent plan for a boy or
girl to say their prayers every night. For
you have probably done something wrong
during the day, and you ought not to go
to sleep until you are forgiven. Besides,
God has taken care of you through the
day, and you ought not to go to sleep till
you have sincerely thanked him, and asked
him to take care of you through the night,
while you sleep. I will tell you what
Rollo&#8217;s prayer was, and I think you had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
better learn it, and say it every night before
you go to sleep, unless you have already
learned some other one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">The Prayer.</p>

<p>Now that another day is gone, and I
lay down my head upon my pillow to rest,
I come to thee, Almighty God, my Heavenly
Father, to ask thee to forgive my
sins, and to take care of me this night.</p>

<p>I have done wrong a great many times,&mdash;and
destroyed my own peace of mind,
and made my father and mother unhappy,
and displeased thee. I pray thee, O God,
to forgive me for Jesus Christ my Saviour&#8217;s
sake; and wilt thou keep my heart
that I may do wrong no more. Help me,
every day, to try to please thee more and
more, so that I may be thy dutiful and
obedient child while I live, and my soul
be saved when I die.</p>

<p>And now wilt thou come and be near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
my bed-side while I sleep, keep me safe
until the morning; and always, whether I
wake or sleep, whether I live or die, wilt
thou be with me, and love me, and take
care of me, forever, for Jesus&#8217; sake.</p>

<p class="right">Amen.</p></blockquote>



<p>It will do no good to say this or any
other prayer, unless you say it seriously
and sincerely, and are really sorry for
having done wrong, and resolved to do so
no more.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BUNNY.<br />

<small>A FICTITIOUS STORY.</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> there was a beautiful wood, and
in it many large trees. In one of these
trees was a large hole; the bottom of the
hole was covered with dry leaves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
moss. Here lived Mr. and Mrs. Squirrel,
with their five children, named Creep,
Peep, Bushy, Grey and Bunny. They
were good little squirrels, and might have
been a very happy family, had not Bunny
been discontented. She tried to make
the others so too. She would very often
crowd her brothers and sisters, and fret
because she had not room.</p>

<p>One day their father and mother were
away, running about in the woods, trying
to find something for them to eat. The
little squirrels were playing together very
pleasantly, till Bunny pushed Creep against
Peep, and then shoved Bushy, telling
them to move, for she had not room. In
truth, Bunny was often a very naughty
squirrel, and made her father and mother
very unhappy. Very often they would
lie awake at night thinking how they
should make her a better child, and kind
and pleasant to her brothers and sisters.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>When they came home, the day I have
mentioned, from their ramble in search of
something to eat, they saw that their children
looked very sober and unhappy, and
Creep, who was the oldest, told them how
Bunny had behaved. Creep was a very
good squirrel, and her parents could always
believe her. She never tried to
make her brothers and sisters seem more
naughty than they were.</p>

<p>That night, Mr. and Mrs. Squirrel
talked about Bunny before they went to
sleep, and concluded they <i>must</i> put a stop
to her naughty behavior.</p>

<p>The next morning, Bunny&#8217;s father got
up and asked her to go and walk with
him. She went, and they walked in the
beautiful wood. There were nuts, and
acorns, and berries, and Bunny longed to
eat as many as she wanted.</p>

<p>Presently her father told her how very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
wrong she had behaved, and that he must
punish her. So he took her up with his
fore paw, and ran up a tree. The tree
was very tall, and it was a good while
before they got far up. Poor little Bunny
was very much frightened. At last they
came to a small, dark hole, just large
enough for her to turn round in. Here
her father put her in, and told her she
must stay there. Then he went away,
and left her here alone, and she could hear
her father&#8217;s feet pat along the tree as he
went down, and then the dry leaves on
the ground rustle as he ran over them.</p>

<p>Dinner time came, and Bunny hoped
her father would come with some dinner.
But no,&mdash;he did not come. She began to
cry, for she was hungry. She felt with
her paw all round, and could only find one
little acorn and some dried leaves. She
looked out of the hole, but was afraid to
go out, it was so high up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>She now began to feel very sorry. She
knew how unkind she had been to her
brothers and sisters. She cried, and
thought if her father would come and
take her home, she would not crowd and
push and fret any more.</p>

<p>Supper time came, but she could not
hear any one coming.</p>

<p>The sun set,&mdash;it began to grow dark,
and the winds blew and whistled through
the trees. At last, down poured the rain,
and it came into the hole, and poor little
Bunny was completely wet.</p>

<p>Presently she thought she heard a
scratching and a patting on the leaves, and
then upon the tree; and very soon up
came her father. He saw that little Bunny
looked sorry. She told her father she
would try and be a good, pleasant squirrel
if he would take her home, and give her
some supper. So he took her up with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
his paw, and down the tree they went,
and soon got home to their very warm
nest. Here was a fine supper of sweet
acorns&mdash;and the family were all glad to
see little Bunny again, and whenever she
began to be naughty, she thought of the
dark hole where she had been left alone
and without supper, and she became a
very good little squirrel, and was ever
afterwards a great comfort to her parents.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">THE RAFT.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Do</span> you remember any thing about
Jonas;&mdash;how they found him by the side
of the road and brought him home? When
Rollo&#8217;s father found him, he meant to have
sent him to the poor-house, where all
poor boys are taken care of, but he kept
him in his house a few days first, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
found that he was a very good boy. He
had a great many faults, but he was a good-natured,
pleasant boy, and he was willing
to learn, and so Rollo&#8217;s father thought he
would let him stay and live with him, and
work for him.</p>

<p>Jonas was very industrious and faithful.
Do you know what industrious means?
Do you know what faithful means? He
was kind too. He was very kind to Rollo.
He used to help Rollo a great deal,
and play with him, and tell him stories.</p>

<p>There was a beautiful brook very near
the house which Rollo lived in. I have
made you a picture of the elm yard, behind
the house. By and by, I shall make
you a picture of all the house, and the
trees, and fields around it, and the brook,
and then you will understand it all exactly.
Now I can only tell you there was a
brook, and Jonas used to take Rollo down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to the brook sometimes to play. The
brook was wide, and the water flowed
slowly and smoothly, but it was not very
deep. Jonas liked to be near the water.
He had sailed over the seas, and he liked
the water.</p>

<p>One day Jonas found two great logs on
the shore of the brook. He rolled them
into the water. Then he went up to the
house and got some pieces of board, and
a hammer and some nails. He gave Rollo
the hammer and nails to carry, and he
carried the boards. He walked back then
to the pond. He floated the logs side by
side, and nailed the boards across, and
then he stood upon it, and it bore him up
on the water. Jonas called it his raft.
Then he took a pole and pushed himself
off from the shore and shouted, &#8220;<span class="smcap">Hurrah</span>,
<span class="smcap">Hurrah</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rollo stood upon the shore looking at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
him, and Rollo too shouted, &#8220;<span class="smcap">Hurrah</span>,
<span class="smcap">Hurrah</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Rollo said, &#8220;Let me get on and
sail too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jonas, &#8220;not till I ask your
mother if she is willing.&#8221;</p>

<p>That day when they went home, Rollo
asked his father and mother if they were
willing that he should sail on Jonas&#8217;s raft.
His father said he would go down and
look at it. When he came to the brook,
he was surprised to see such a good
strong raft, and he said that Rollo might
sail on it, if they would both be careful.
Then Jonas got on before, and pushed
with his pole, and Rollo sat behind and
held on, and they sailed away up towards
the bridge. You can see them in the
picture. You can see the raft, and Jonas
pushing with a pole, and Rollo holding on,
and the brook, and the bridge. Rollo and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Jonas had a great many good sails on this
raft.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CONTRARY CHARLES.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Do</span> you know what a contrary boy is?
I will tell you. He is one who is never
satisfied with what he has, but always
wants something different. If I were to
say to you, &#8220;Come, James, and see what a
pretty <i>picture</i> I have got here;&#8221; and you
should say, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want a picture,
you said you would bring me a pretty
book,&#8221;&mdash;that would be being <i>contrary</i>. If
your father should bring you home a little
cart to draw about the room, and you
should say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want a cart, I don&#8217;t
like carts, I want a horse and whip, like
William&#8217;s;&#8221; that would be being very
contrary.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>Now I knew a little boy once, who was
unhappy a great deal of the time, because
he would not be pleased with the playthings
he had, but always wanted another
kind, or something else. This little boy
had a very kind father and mother, who
loved him very much, and who tried to
make him happy. They bought him good
clothes to wear: they gave him good
things to eat whenever he was hungry,
and they bought him a great many pretty
playthings. But though they were so
kind, this boy was sometimes so naughty
as to cry when they gave him a new
plaything, because he had wanted a bunch
of jack-straws, perhaps, instead of a pretty
box of wooden blocks. If they had
bought him some jack-straws, he would
have wanted the blocks or something else.
Nobody liked to give Charles any playthings
or sugar-plums or any thing, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
they did not make him happy: and
they did not make him happy because he
would not be pleased, but always thought
of something else which he fancied he
would rather have.</p>

<p>One day, Charles&#8217; mother came into
the room where he was playing, and said,
&#8220;Charles, little brother William is going
to walk with Susan. Should you like to
go too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but I shall want to
wear my new cap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I told you the other day,&#8221; said
his mother, &#8220;that you could not wear it
for a whole week again, because you
threw it upon the floor when you came in
yesterday, instead of hanging it on the
nail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I don&#8217;t want to go,&#8221; said Charles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said his mother, and calling
to Susan, she told her she need not
wait any longer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>&#8220;But I <i>shall</i> want to go,&#8221; said Charles,
beginning to cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not go now,&#8221; said his mother,
&#8220;for you said you did not want to
go, just because you felt contrary, and
out of humor.&#8221;</p>

<p>His mother then sat down to work.
Charles, finding it was useless to cry,
dried his tears, and began throwing his
playthings about the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you do so,&#8221; said his mother,
&#8220;you will break that pretty box, and your
white cards, with the pretty colored letters,
will get soiled, and not fit to be
used.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care if they do,&#8221; said Charles,
&#8220;it is not a pretty box, and I don&#8217;t like
the cards.&#8221;</p>

<p>His mother rose, took away all his
playthings, and left him sitting upon the
floor, with nothing to do. As she took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
no notice of his cross looks, he presently
went to the window, and stood on a little
cricket, looking to see the horses and
carriages passing, and soon he began to
feel pleasantly again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! mother,&#8221; said he, &#8220;there are two
beautiful little dogs in the street, and a
little boy running after them. Oh! how
I should like a little dog. Mother, will
you buy me one?&#8221; and he ran to his
mother and looked up in her face.</p>

<p>His mother laid down her work, and
took him in her lap. &#8220;What would you
do with a dog,&#8221; said she, &#8220;if you had
one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I should play with him; I would
put some things in my cart, and tie the
dog to it, and let him draw it to market;
just like the dog in William&#8217;s picture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am afraid,&#8221; said his mother,
&#8220;that if your father should buy you a dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
you would sometimes get out of humor
with him, and then you would say it was
an ugly dog, and you did not want it any
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I would not,&#8221; said Charles; &#8220;I
should always love my little dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you said, if I would buy you a new
cap, you would be a good boy, and never
give me any trouble about it; but yesterday
you forgot your promise, and did not
put it where it belongs; and to-day you
have made me very unhappy by your bad
temper. And you have displeased God
too, for he was looking directly into your
heart when you said you did not want to
go with Susan, and saw that you were
saying what was not true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I will remember next time, if you
will only get me a little dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then William came into the room
with a large piece of cake in his hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
which a lady had given him. He went
up to his brother, and breaking it in two
pieces offered him one of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I want the other piece,&#8221; said
Charles.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t give it to you,&#8221; said William;
&#8220;I want it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I won&#8217;t have any,&#8221; said Charles,
impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep all the cake yourself, William,&#8221;
said his mother; &#8220;Charles must not have
any, because he is not a good boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I do want some,&#8221; said Charles,
beginning to cry very loud. Then his
mother went to the door, and calling
Susan, told her to take Charles into the
other room, and keep him there until he
was perfectly pleasant and good-humored.
So you see Charles lost a pleasant walk,
and a nice piece of cake; and, after all,
had to be sent away from his kind mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
just because he would be a contrary boy.
Do you think he was happy?</p>

<p>The next afternoon, as these two little
boys were playing in the yard, they looked
up, and saw a carriage, drawn by two
large, white horses, stop at the door. It
was their aunt&#8217;s. She had brought her
little son and daughter, named James and
Mary, to spend the afternoon with their
cousins. As soon as they were out of the
carriage, they ran to their cousins, and
all looked as happy as if they were expecting
to have a noble, good time; and
so they were.</p>

<p>Their aunt went into the house, and
the children played together out in the
yard. When they were tired of that, they
went into the mowing field, where the hay
was spread to dry, and began to throw it
upon each other. This they enjoyed very
much till Charles began to cry, and say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
they should not throw the hay upon him.
He wanted to <i>pelt</i> the others, but was not
willing to have them pelt him. So this
contrary boy spoilt the whole play, and
he cried so loud that his mother had to
call him into the house. When he was
gone, James lay down in the hay, and
told his sister and cousin to cover him up
in it. When he was hidden entirely, so
that they could not see him, he jumped
up suddenly, and ran to catch them with
an arm full of hay, to <i>pay</i> them for treating
him so. They laughed very loud,
and were very happy, now they had no
one to disturb them with crying. They
were soon called in to tea.</p>

<p>Charles had not been very well in the
morning, and his mother was afraid to give
him as many strawberries in his milk as
she did the rest. So Charles began to
cry, and said he would not have any. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
mother then sent him out of the room,
and did not allow him to return until his
cousins had gone.</p>

<p>You see how many pleasant things he
lost by being so contrary. His mother
said she could not buy him a dog until he
had learned to be a good, pleasant boy.
His cousins said they did not want to go
and see him again, for he spoiled their
play; and when his mother went to see
his aunt, she took William, but left Charles
at home. She said she could not take
him with her until he was willing to do
as others wished to have him, and not
always cry to have his own way. By
and by, Charles learned that it was better
to be pleasant all the time, and not get
out of humor when things did not exactly
suit him; and then every body loved him,
for he was a good little boy in every
other respect.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FROST ON THE WINDOWS.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span> was a little boy. One cold
winter&#8217;s morning his mother brought him
down stairs. It was very early. She put
him down on the carpet, before a bright,
warm fire. Then she opened the shutters
to see if it was light. Charles saw
something white and shining upon the
windows, and called to her, and said, &#8220;Oh,
mother, mother, how beautiful! See how
the windows are painted all white. <i>There</i>
is a mountain, and another,&mdash;and&mdash;and
I see another on the top of it; and there
are some trees, and flowers&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they are very beautiful,&#8221; said
Charles&#8217; mamma, as she stood dressing
her little boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes it look so? It isn&#8217;t
light like day,&mdash;and oh! mother, see,
there is a bright star in the sky!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>&#8220;It is not quite daylight yet; pretty
soon it will grow lighter, and the little star
will not look so bright, and then the sky
will grow brighter, and it will be daylight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it now; is it night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it is day-dawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Day-dawn;&mdash;well, it&#8217;s very pretty, I
think, mother. O, see, there&#8217;s a cow! I
think those are pictures painted on the
window, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they are not pictures. Don&#8217;t you
know what they are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see something that looks like a
horse that hasn&#8217;t got any head, and some
trees that haven&#8217;t got any branches, and
a great many more mountains and rocks.
I think they are pictures, but they look
white, just like snow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Charles, the cold made those
pictures. We call it frost on the windows,
and it came last night while we were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
asleep. It was very cold indeed last
night, and a great many things froze very
hard. Now hark, what do you hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark! I hear something that ticks
just like a watch. What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the cold frost which has frozen
some water in the tumbler. Last night
it was water, and I drank some of it.
Now look here; it is ice, and it looks very
beautiful. See all those little marks and
spots. Those are little bubbles. Now it
goes <i>click, click</i>, again. See how hard it
is; I cannot break it with my finger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, will the frost stay all day on
the windows, or go away when it is daylight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not when it is daylight, but when the
room is warm. There is a good, bright
fire in the grate, and it will make the room
warm, and by and by the sun will rise out
of doors and shine on the glass, and warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
it, and the frost will melt. Then it will
be water and run down in drops.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I think it is very pretty frost,
and I don&#8217;t think I could make such
horses, and trees, and cows.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SHOOTING A BEAR.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> there was a foolish man, who
was always afraid of bears. He was always
afraid there were bears in the woods
around him, and that they would come
and eat him up.</p>

<p>One day he thought he would take his
gun and go out and shoot a bear. So he
took down his gun, and put in some powder
to load it, and then he put in some
paper to keep the powder in, and then he
put in a bullet over that. The bullet was
a round, heavy thing, like a round stone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
He put another piece of paper in next, to
keep the bullet down. How do you suppose
he got the paper down to the bottom
of his gun? Why, he had a long,
slender iron, which he called his ramrod,
and he pushed the paper down with his
long, slender ramrod. Then he pulled
the ramrod out, and slid it into its proper
place by the side of his gun.</p>

<p>Did you ever see any gunpowder?
When you set it on fire, it flashes up very
quick. There is a picture of some boys
burning gunpowder in Rollo Learning to
Talk. If the gunpowder is in a close
place when it is set on fire, it bursts out
violently, and makes a noise. This man&#8217;s
gun was a close place, and he expected
that when he should see the bear, he
should point his gun at the bear, and then
set fire to the powder down in the bottom
of his gun, and that the powder would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
flash and burst out, and drive out the
round, heavy bullet, and make it <i>whiz</i>
through the air very swiftly, and go into
the bear and kill him.</p>

<p>But how do you think he was going to
set fire to the powder which was away
down in the bottom of his gun, under the
paper and the bullet? I will tell you how.
There was a little hole, a very little one,
in the side of his gun, opposite where the
powder was, and he put a little powder
into that hole. The name of the hole is
the touch-hole. Close by that hole there
were some things fixed which would strike
together and make sparks. They would
strike together when he pulled a little
thing. The little thing he pulled was the
trigger. So that when he should be all
ready, and should have the gun pointing
at the bear, he would only pull the trigger,
and that would make the flint and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
steel strike together, and that would make
sparks which would fall upon the powder
in the little touch-hole, and it would burn
in, quick, with a flash, and set the powder
in the gun on fire, and that would drive
the bullet out, and make it whiz through
the air and kill the bear. That is the
way the man expected to shoot. That is
the way they always shoot.</p>

<p>Just before he was ready to shoot, he
always had to pull back the flint, so as to
get the flint and the trigger in the right
place, and when he did this it would say
<i>click</i>. This would be <i>cocking</i> his gun.
Then it would be ready to fire.</p>

<p>When the gun was all ready excepting
being cocked, the man put it on his
shoulder, and went off into the woods.
He looked all about him, but for a long
time he could not see any bear. At last
he saw a strange looking thing up in a
tree, among the leaves.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if that is not a
bear.&#8221;</p>

<p>It looked rather strangely, and he could
not tell what it was if it was <i>not</i> a bear.
So he thought he might as well shoot it.
He accordingly took down his gun from
his shoulder, and pulled back the flint, and
heard it say <i>click</i>. Then he pointed the
gun up towards the strange looking thing
in the tree, and he pulled the trigger.
<i>Crackle</i> went the sparks, <i>flash</i> went the
powder in the touch-hole, <i>pop</i> went the
gun, <i>whiz</i> went the bullet through the
air, and the man looked, expecting to see
the bear fall down dead from the tree.</p>

<p>Instead of that he could see, when the
smoke cleared away a little, that the
strange looking thing appeared exactly
as it did before. He went round a little
to see it better, and what do you think it
was? Why, it was only a crooked branch
of the tree.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I made a mistake. I
ought to have waited until I saw whether
it moved. Bears move. Next time I
will not fire at any thing unless it moves.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he went along a little farther, looking
around on all the trees. At last he
saw something upon a tree, moving; he
thought that must be a bear. So he took
his gun down quick off of his shoulder,
and he pulled back the flint, and it said
<i>click</i>, and he pointed the gun up into the
tree, and then he pulled the trigger.
<i>Crackle</i> went the sparks, <i>flash</i> went the
powder in the little touch-hole, <i>pop</i> went
the gun, <i>whiz</i> went the bullet through
the air, <i>puff</i> went the smoke, and the
man looked, expecting to see the bear
fall down dead from the tree.</p>

<p>Instead of that, what do you think he
saw? Why, it was nothing but a little
squirrel, with a long, bushy tail, running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
away on a limb of the tree, as fast as he
could go. What the man saw moving
was only the tip of his tail; the rest of
him was round behind the tree, and he
thought it was a bear round there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;I made another
little mistake. Bears are black. This
squirrel&#8217;s tail is gray. I must not fire at
any thing again unless it is <i>black</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he walked along, looking about him
carefully, and up into all the trees. By
and by he saw something moving. He
looked up and saw that it was black. It
was the little tip of a black thing; he
could only see a little of it. The rest was
round behind the tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; says the man, &#8220;I <i>know</i> I have
found a bear; for it is black, and bears
are black.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he loaded his gun, and got it all
ready. <i>Click</i>, said the lock when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
cocked it. He pointed up towards the
tree. In a minute he pulled the trigger,&mdash;<i>flash</i>
went the powder in the touch-hole,
<i>pop</i> went the gun, <i>whiz</i> went the
bullet through the air, and the man
looked, expecting to see the bear fall
down dead from the tree.</p>

<p>Instead of that, what do you think he
saw? Why, it was only a little blackbird,
flying off through the branches as
fast as he could go. The black thing
which the man saw moving was only the
blackbird&#8217;s tail, <i>projecting</i> out from behind
the tree, and he thought it was a
black bear round there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;I made a mistake
again. Bears are <i>large</i>, as well as
black. This was very <i>little</i>. I must not
fire at any thing again unless it is large
as well as black.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he walked along, looking about him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
carefully, and up into all the trees. By
and by he saw something very strange.
It was a little way up a tree, clinging to a
branch. It was partly hid by the leaves,
so that he could not see it very well, but
he knew that it was black, and it was
large, and it was moving.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; says the man, &#8220;I am certain
I have found a bear, for it is large and
black, and bears are large and black.
Besides, it moves.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he loaded his gun, and rammed
down the bullet with his ramrod, and
pulled back the flint. It said <i>click</i>. Then
he knew that all was ready. He was
sure of his bear this time, and he determined
to drag him home by the ears.</p>

<p>He pointed his gun up at the large,
black thing, and pulled the trigger.
<i>Flash</i>, went the powder in the touch-hole,
<i>pop</i> went the gun, <i>whiz</i> went the bullet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
through the air, and the man looked,
expecting to see the bear fall down dead
from the tree.</p>

<p>Instead of that, a man came rushing
out of the bushes, calling out,</p>

<p>&#8220;Halloa there,&mdash;what are you shooting
my coat for?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man was at first so astonished
that he could hardly speak. Presently
he said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a wood-cutter. I came out
here to cut wood, and I hung my coat on
the tree; now you have shot a hole
through it!!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that your coat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it was a bear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A bear!!&#8221; said the wood-cutter with
astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I thought there were bears in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the woods, and that they would come out
and eat me up; so I came to shoot one.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p145.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">WHAT ARE YOU SHOOTING MY COAT FOR?&mdash;Page 144.</p>

<p>&#8220;You silly man,&#8221; said the wood-cutter.
&#8220;There are no bears in the woods near
such towns as we live in. Besides, if
there were, they never would come out
of the woods and eat people up. Nobody
is afraid of bears but silly little children.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">
JACK HILDIGO.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Jonas</span> used to sit down with Rollo very
often and amuse him by telling him stories.
The story which Rollo liked the
best was the story of Jack Hildigo. The
story of Jack Hildigo was a very curious
one. The reason why I put it in this
book is because it is very hard to read
right, and you must read it aloud and distinctly,
till you learn to read it well.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>When Jonas told this story, they called
it <i>playing</i> Jack Hildigo. It took several
children to play it well. Sometimes when
John and Samuel, who lived in another
house, came over to play with Rollo, they
would all sit down together, on the platform,
in the garden-yard, and have a fine
time playing Jack Hildigo.</p>

<p>Jonas would begin telling the story
thus, the other children sitting all around
him:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Once there was a boy, and his name
was Jack Hildigo. One day he went
round behind his father&#8217;s house, and found
there a great hole leading under the house.
So he thought he would go into that
hole, and see what was there. He went
in under the house, but he found nothing.
So he stood there, and began to growl
like a bear, so,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;U-r-r, u-r-r, u-r-r.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>Here Jonas, who was telling the story,
said, U-r-r, u-r-r, u-r-r, growling as much
as he could like a bear.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Presently there came along a large turkey,
saying, Gobble-gobble-gobble. And
the turkey said, &#8216;I wonder what there is
in that great, black hole.&#8217; And the turkey
said, &#8216;Hark! I hear a strange noise in
that great, black hole, something growling
like a bear. I wonder what that is that
is growling like a bear.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So the turkey walked along and
looked in, and he said, &#8216;Oh, it is nothing
but Jack Hildigo. I am not afraid of
Jack Hildigo. I will go in and gobble,
while he growls like a bear.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So the turkey went in and stood by
the side of Jack Hildigo; and the turkey
said, Gobble-gobble-gobble, and Jack Hildigo
growled like a bear, so.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>Jonas would say, U-r-r, u-r-r, u-r-r,
growling like a bear, and Rollo would
say, Gobble-gobble-gobble, gobble-gobble-gobble,
gobble-gobble-gobble, three
times, and no more. This would make
Rollo laugh. Then Jonas went on with
the story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;By and by there came along a duck,
a waddling, quacking duck. And the
duck said, &#8216;I wonder what there is in
that great, black hole.&#8217; And the duck
said, &#8216;Hark! I hear a strange noise in
that great, black hole, something growling
like a bear. I wonder what that is that
is growling like a bear.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So the duck walked along and looked
in, and he said, &#8216;Oh, it is nothing but
Jack Hildigo and a turkey. I am not
afraid of Jack Hildigo.&#8217; So the duck
went in and stood by the turkey, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
said, Quack-quack-quack, and the turkey
said, Gobble-gobble-gobble, and Jack Hildigo
growled like a bear, so.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here Jonas would say, U-r-r, u-r-r,
u-r-r, and Rollo would say, Gobble-gobble-gobble,
gobble-gobble-gobble, gobble-gobble-gobble,
and John would say, Quack-quack-quack,
quack-quack-quack, quack-quack-quack,
all together, three times,
and no more. Here Jonas would go on
with the story.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;By and by there came along a dog,
a large dog, a large, black dog, with a bone
in his mouth. And the dog said, &#8216;I wonder
what there is in that great, black hole.&#8217;
And when he came nearer he heard a
noise. And he said, &#8216;Hark! what noise
is that? It is something growling like a
bear.&#8217; So he walked along carefully, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
when he got near the hole, he said, &#8216;Oh,
it is only Jack Hildigo and a turkey and
a duck! I am not afraid of Jack Hildigo,
or the turkey, or the duck. I will go in
and bow-wow-wow.&#8217; So he went in and
stood by the side of the duck. And the
dog said, Bow-wow-wow, and the duck
said, Quack-quack-quack, and the turkey
said, Gobble-gobble-gobble, and Jack
Hildigo growled like a bear, so.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here Jonas would say, U-r-r, u-r-r,
u-r-r, growling like a bear, and Rollo
would say, Gobble-gobble-gobble, gobble-gobble-gobble,
gobble-gobble-gobble, and
John would say, Quack-quack-quack,
and Samuel would say, Bow-wow-wow,
bow-wow-wow, bow-wow-wow, three
times, and no more. This would make
them all laugh, and then Jonas would go
on with the story.</p>

<blockquote>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>&#8220;In the yard of that house was a pig.
He was lying down with his nose in the
mud. And after lying there some time,
he thought he would get up and take a
walk.</p>

<p>&#8220;So he walked along till he came
round behind the house, and he saw a
great hole in the wall. And he said, &#8216;I
wonder what there is in that great, black
hole.&#8217; And when he came nearer, he
heard a noise, and he said, &#8216;Hark! what
noise is that? It is something growling
like a bear.&#8217; So he walked along carefully,
but when he got near the hole, he
said, &#8216;Oh, it is only Jack Hildigo. I am
not afraid of Jack Hildigo. I will go in
and grunt, while he growls like a bear.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>When Jonas got as far as this, in telling
the story one day, he stopped, and said he
could not go any farther, for there was nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to play pig. But he said if he could
only get four or five more boys some
time, he could tell a good deal further, and
they should have a great deal more fun.</p>

<p>This is the end of the story about Jack
Hildigo.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">
HOW TO TREAT A KITTEN.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once a boy named James,
and one day his father came home and
said, &#8220;James, I have got something for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, father?&#8221; said James.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I will show it to you presently,&#8221;
said his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is it?&#8221; said James.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is in a little basket, which I left
out in the other room.&#8221;</p>

<p>So when James&#8217; father had put away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
his hat and whip, he went out into the
other room, and presently came in bringing
a basket in his hands, which he was
holding carefully by the handle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let me see, let me see,&#8221; said
James; and he came up to his father, and
began to pull down the basket.</p>

<p>This was wrong, for children ought
never to attempt to pull any thing away
from their father. It was foolish too, as
well as wrong, for James could not succeed
in pulling it away. The more he
pulled, the higher his father held up the
basket, until at last his father told him to
let go. He obeyed.</p>

<p>Then his father held the basket down
low. He put it in a chair, and James
stood by the side of it. He saw that
there was a cloth spread over the top
of it, and tied round the basket. James&#8217;
father untied the string, and unwound it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and then carefully lifted up the cloth, and
James looked in and saw there a beautiful
gray kitten.</p>

<p>The kitten appeared afraid; she curled
down into a corner of the basket, and
looked up as if she was frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, father,&#8221; said James, &#8220;let me
take her out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said his father, &#8220;but do it
carefully.&#8221;</p>

<p>So James put his hands in to take up
the kitten; but when she saw them coming,
it frightened her more, and she
jumped up to the top of the basket, and
then leaped out upon the chair, and from
the chair to the floor. She ran along the
floor. At the same instant, James ran
after her, holding out his hands, saying,
&#8220;Oh, catch her, catch her.&#8221; His father
only turned round quietly, and shut the
door. He was much wiser than James,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
for James&#8217; bustle and noise only made
the kitten more frightened, while his father
quietly did what would effectually
keep the kitten from running away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, James,&#8221; said his father, &#8220;let the
kitten stay there under the table a minute
or two, while I tell you something. You
see how frightened she looks. She is
afraid you will hurt her. Now, if you
treat her very gently and kindly for a few
days, and do not try to catch her at first,
she will soon find out that you are her
friend, and she will not be afraid of you.
She will let you take her, and play with
her as much as you please. But if you
handle her roughly, or tease her in any
way, she will be always wild.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then James&#8217; father went away.</p>

<p>James stood a minute or two looking
at his kitten, and then he thought he
would go and catch her. So he walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
along towards the table, and then stooped
down to take up the kitten, but she suddenly
turned round, and ran under the
chairs, and hid behind a basket, in one
corner of the room.</p>

<p>James ran after her. He pulled away
the basket, and saw the kitten for an instant
crouching in a corner of the room,
staring wildly at him, and evidently very
much terrified. The moment she found
that the basket was taken away, and that
she was exposed again, she started off,
ran directly across the room, towards a
large clock which was in the opposite
corner, and squeezed under it.</p>

<p>James now did not know what to do.
He could not move the great, heavy clock.
He put his face close down to the floor,
and looked under, and he could just see
the kitten&#8217;s two shining eyes there, but
he could not reach in, to take her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said he at last, &#8220;I know what I
can do. I can go and get father&#8217;s cane,
and then I can <i>poke</i> her out.&#8221; So he
went out into the entry and got the cane,
and came back, and began to thrust it under,
and behind the clock. The poor kitten
was much more frightened to hear
this thumping around her, and to feel the
great stick punching her sides; so presently
she darted out, ran across the room,
and out through the door which James
had left open.</p>

<p>James followed her, brandishing<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">*</a> his
cane. When he got to the entry, he
found that the kitten was half way up
stairs. He immediately began to go up
as fast as he could, but she could go
faster. She leaped up from step to step,
then ran along the passage way at the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
until she reached the door leading to the
garret, which James saw, to his chagrin,
was open a very little.</p>

<p>Do you know what chagrin means? It
means the feeling James had when he saw
that the garret door was open. What
sort of a feeling do you think that was?</p>

<p>The kitten squeezed through the opening
of the garret door, and disappeared.
James opened the door wide, and went
up nearly to the top of the garret stairs,
and looked into the garret. It was rather
dark there, and the boards looked loose
on the floor, and there were a great many
boxes and barrels there, and James was
afraid to go in. So he stood there and
called &#8220;Kitty, kitty, kitty.&#8221; But the
kitty knew him by this time too well to
come.</p>

<p>Now James began to be sorry that he
had not taken his father&#8217;s advice, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
treated his kitten more gently and kindly.
He was afraid she was lost, and that he
could never get her again.</p>

<p>That night, at tea time, when his father
had heard all about it, he reproved James
for his harsh and cruel treatment of his
kitten, and told him that he thought he
deserved to lose her entirely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I <i>shall</i> lose her entirely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said his father, &#8220;not this time.
I think I can get her out of the garret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; said James.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, by kindness and gentleness. I
shall draw her out by doing exactly the
opposite to what you did to drive her in.
But I do not believe it will do any good.
I do not think you will ever treat her
kindly enough to make her trust you.&#8221;</p>

<p>James promised that he would; but
his father knew that he did not always
keep his promises.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>That evening, James&#8217; father poured a
little milk into a saucer, and he and James
carried it up garret, and put it upon the
floor, and then came directly down again.
The next morning they went up to look
at it, and found that the milk was gone.
They then brought down the saucer, filled
it again, and carried it back. They stopped
a minute to look round for the kitten,
and presently they saw her behind a barrel.
James wanted to go and catch her,
but his father would not let him. His
father said, &#8220;Poor pussy, poor pussy,&#8221;
in a gentle, soothing tone, and put the
saucer down where she could see it, and
then led James away down stairs. When
he went out that morning, he forbid James
going to the garret till he came home.</p>

<p>At noon they carried some more milk
up, and the kitten came out a little way
towards them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>&#8220;There,&#8221; said James&#8217; father, &#8220;do you
not see the effect of kindness?&#8221;</p>

<p>He then put the saucer down, and went
back with James a few steps, and stood
still. The kitten came up to the saucer
and began to drink the milk.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Now</i> let us go and catch her,&#8221; said
James.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said his father.</p>

<p>After the kitten had drunk all the
milk, she ran back behind the barrel, and
James and his father came down stairs.</p>

<p>The next time they went up, they stood
close by the saucer, and the kitten came
up slowly and cautiously. James&#8217; father
gently stroked her back while she was
feeding, and James thought he was certainly
going to catch her then. But he
did not; he let her drink the milk and
then go back behind the barrels.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>&#8220;Why, father, are you not <i>ever</i> going
to catch her?&#8221; said James.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said his father, &#8220;when the
proper time comes&#8221;; and they went down
stairs.</p>

<p>The next time they came, the kitten
came running out to meet them, and they
held the saucer down. When she came
near, James&#8217; father reached out his hand,
and took her up gently and said, &#8220;Now
we will carry her down stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let <i>me</i> carry her,&#8221; said James.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you may,&#8221; said his father; &#8220;but
you must hold her very carefully.&#8221; So
James took the kitten, and his father took
the saucer, and they went down stairs.
They put the kitten and the saucer under
the table, and pretty soon, though she
seemed rather frightened at first, she began
to drink. James&#8217; father forbid his
touching her, or doing any thing to her,
all day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>Thus, in a few days, the kitten became
considerably tame, and would let James
play with her, but he soon began to handle
her roughly again. He would pull
her by the tail, and carry her around
under his arm, and try to make her stand
up on her hind legs, and do a great many
other things, which he thought was very
good fun for him, but which were very
terrifying or painful to her. The kitten
became very much afraid of him. She
would never let him play with her, or
catch her, if she could possibly get away,
and often in struggling to get away she
would scratch his hands. Thus the kitten
hated James, and James soon began
to hate the kitten.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a cross, ugly, good for nothing
old puss,&#8221; said he one day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said his father, &#8220;then I
will take her out of your way.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>So his father got the basket, and put
her gently in it, and he spread the cloth
over it, and tied it down; James stood
by, looking sorrowfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with her,
father?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to take her out of your
way. She shall never trouble you any
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then James&#8217; father put on his hat, and
took the basket and walked away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some months afterwards James went
to see Rollo. He found Rollo out on the
platform, in the garden-yard. You remember
the picture of the garden-yard.
You can see the platform in the picture
if you look back.</p>

<p>When James arrived at the house, and
went through to the yard to see Rollo, he
found him playing horses. He had a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
wooden cart, very small, with a string tied
to it, and was trotting about on the platform.
And who do you think he had in
the cart for a driver? Why, it was a little
<i>gray kitten</i>! She was lying down in
the cart with her fore paws resting on the
front of it, and her chin resting on her
fore paws, and she seemed to enjoy her
ride very much. She looked so funny
that James could not help laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what a beautiful kitten!&#8221; said
he. &#8220;I wish I had such a kitten. I had
one once, but she was not such a tame,
good kitten as that,&mdash;she was an old,
cross, ugly, good for nothing puss. She
did nothing but scratch me.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now it happened that this was the very
kitten which James had, though James
did not know it. His father had come
and given it to Rollo. Rollo called her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Ooty, and he made her gentle and tame
by treating her kindly.</p>

OVERBOARD.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Do</span> you recollect what you read about
Jonas&#8217; raft in another part of this book?
One day, when Jonas was going down to
the brook with Rollo, there was the following
<i>dialogue</i> between Rollo&#8217;s father
and mother.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> I am afraid to have Rollo
sail with Jonas on that raft, as he calls
it. I am very much afraid he will get
in, some day.</p>

<p><i>Father.</i> I presume he <i>will</i> get in.</p>

<p>Rollo&#8217;s mother looked surprised. She
thought it was strange that his father
should let him go on the water, when he
thought he probably would fall in.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span><i>Father.</i> Perhaps I ought rather to say
I think it not improbable that he will
get in.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Why then do you allow him
to go?</p>

<p><i>Father.</i> Because the water is not deep,
and with Jonas with him, who is a strong
and a faithful boy, I think he cannot be
hurt; and if he should grow careless and
inattentive, and fall off of the raft, it would
do him a great deal of good.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> What good would it do him?</p>

<p><i>Father.</i> It would make him more
careful in future; and besides, an actual
plunge into the water where it is deep
enough to frighten a boy, will teach him
more of the nature of water, than an
hour&#8217;s talk to him about its properties.
A fall off of Jonas&#8217; raft may, not very
improbably, be the means of saving his
life, by making him careful, when he
shall be exposed to real danger.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>Rollo&#8217;s father was right; Rollo did fall
off. One day, when he and Jonas were
sailing up towards the bridge, Jonas was
standing behind pushing, and Rollo was
sitting on before. Rollo took up a long
stick which was on the raft, and thought
he would stand up, and push too. Jonas
stood with his back to him, and did not
see him. Rollo pushed his stick down
into the water, but the bottom was farther
off than it seemed to be, and leaning over,
he lost his balance, and away he went all
over into the water. In an instant Jonas
plunged in after him, and dragged him
out upon the bank. The raft, left to itself,
floated down the stream.</p>

<p>Rollo&#8217;s mother put on dry clothes, and
when Rollo was warm again, she said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps now you think I shall forbid
your going down to the brook again, but
I shall not. You may go and sail again
whenever you please.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>She knew that his experience would
make him careful in future, without any
censure from her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">
OLD THINGS AND NEW THINGS.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Which</span> is the prettiest, an <i>old</i> thing
or a <i>new</i> thing? Oh, a <i>new</i> thing to be
sure, you say. A beautiful, new book,
fresh from the bookstore, is a great deal
prettier than an old, worn out, tattered
book, that you have had a great while.</p>

<p>Now there is one great mistake that
small boys very often make. They think
that books and other things become old
and worn out, only because they have had
them a long time; but that is not the reason.
I have seen a great many books,
beautiful books too, full of pictures, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
they had been kept a great many years,
and yet they were not old and worn out.
They looked just as well as when they
were first bought. Now I am going to
explain to you here how you may keep
your things so that they shall not become
old and worn out.</p>

<p>Suppose your father should bring you
home a beautiful book with a red morocco
cover, and full of pictures. It looks
new and beautiful. Now look at the
cover a moment. Do you suppose the
cover is red all through? Suppose any
body should cut the corner off of the
cover, should you expect that it would be
red <i>all through</i> where they cut it? It
would not. It is only red outside. The
red is very thin, very thin indeed, spread
all over the outside of the cover. You
might take a knife and scrape it off in a
little spot, and see that it is very thin, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
that it is some other color underneath.
Perhaps somebody will take some old
book which is not good for much, and
show you what I mean. You must not
try it upon any good books.</p>

<p>Now suppose you should lay your red
morocco book down upon the floor, and
push it along, the floor would rub off a
little of the red morocco. And then suppose
that the next day you should lay it
down on the stone steps, the rough stone
would wear off more of the red morocco.
And then suppose that you should lay it
down open upon the table, or floor; a
little dust from the table or floor would
stick to the leaves, and spoil their whiteness.
And then suppose you should let
your book fall from a chair; it would
bruise one of the corners, and bend it up
a little. So if you go on a great many
days rubbing your book upon the floor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and throwing it about, and tumbling the
leaves, after a short time the beautiful
red color of the cover would be worn off
in spots, and the white paper would get
soiled, and the corners very much bruised,
and the book would begin to look old and
tattered and torn. It would become an
old, worn out book, not because you had
kept it so long, but because you had used
it roughly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">
SELLING A BOY.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> there was a man who was very
poor. He had to work very hard to get
money; but he found it very hard to get
money enough to buy bread for himself,
and his wife, and his little boy. So he
thought he would go and see if he could
not sell his little boy. He took him up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
in his arms, and went out into the street,
and walked along until he came to a shoemaker&#8217;s
shop. He thought that perhaps
the shoemaker would like to buy him.</p>

<p>So he stopped and looked in at the
window, and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Shoemaker,&mdash;Mr. Shoemaker,&mdash;do
you want to buy a little boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>And the shoemaker said, &#8220;Is it a good
little boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>And the man said, &#8220;Yes, he is an excellent
little boy. He always obeys me
exactly, and he is kind and gentle, and
not troublesome, and he tries to do right;
if you buy him, by and by when he grows
up, he can work with you, and help you
make shoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the shoemaker, &#8220;I will
give you a dollar for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A dollar,&#8221; said the man, thinking,
&#8220;shall I take a dollar for my little boy?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Then I should go home alone, and have
nobody to play with me, and get up in
my lap, and hear me tell stories. No,
no, no, I will not sell my little boy for a
dollar.&#8221; So he walked on.</p>

<p>Presently he came to a carpenter&#8217;s
shop. He stopped at the window, and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Carpenter,&mdash;Mr. Carpenter,&mdash;should
you like to buy a little boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little boy!&#8221; said the carpenter;
&#8220;what sort of a boy is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;he is an excellent
little boy. I love him very much,
but I have to sell him because I want
some money to buy me some bread. But
he is a good boy. He is obedient and
faithful, and when he grows up he can
help you saw boards and drive nails.
The shoemaker offered me a dollar, but I
could not sell him for a dollar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the carpenter, &#8220;I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
give you <i>ten</i> dollars for him, for he looks
like a pretty good boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten dollars,&#8221; said the man, thinking,
&#8220;ten dollars. Shall I sell my little boy
for ten dollars? That would buy me a
good deal of bread, but then I should not
have any little boy. I should have nobody
to come and meet me when I get
home, or to sit still by my side when I
am tired. No, no, no, I cannot sell my
little boy for ten dollars.&#8221; So he left the
carpenter&#8217;s and walked on.</p>

<p>The next place he came to was a mill.
There was a great wheel spinning round
and round in the water, and some carts
filled with bags of wheat at the door.
They were going to grind the wheat into
flour. The miller came out to the door.
His clothes looked white. The man said
to him,</p>



<p>&#8220;Miller,&mdash;Mr. Miller,&mdash;I have got a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
boy to sell. Do you want to buy him?&#8221;
As he said this he showed the miller the
little boy who was in his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he a good boy, or a naughty boy?&#8221;
asked the miller; &#8220;for I am sure I do
not want to buy any naughty boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he is a very good boy,&#8221; said the
man. &#8220;He does not cry, only when he
hurts himself, and then he stops crying as
soon as he can. He is not cross, or fretful,
or disobedient, or troublesome. I
know you will like him, and he will help
you a good deal in your mill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the miller, &#8220;I think he is
a good boy, and I should like a good boy
in my mill very much. He could tie up
the bags, and hold the horses at the door.
I will give you a hundred dollars for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A hundred dollars!&#8221; said the man,
&#8220;that&#8217;s a good deal of money. I could
buy a <i>great many</i> loaves of bread with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
hundred dollars. I could buy bread
enough to last me a year, and as long as
the money should last I could have a fine
time resting from all my hard work. But
then I should never see my poor little boy
any more. And then perhaps, he would
not be happy with the miller. He may
have to work too hard, and perhaps some
of the horses which he would have to hold
might kick him. No, I will not sell him
to the miller for a hundred dollars, after
all. I had rather carry him home, and
work the harder.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he left the miller and walked on.
He thought that perhaps somebody would
give him more money for his boy. He
walked on a little way and came to a
large, beautiful white house by the side
of the road. It belonged to a rich gentleman,
who was standing at the door.</p>

<p>He thought he would go and offer him
to this rich gentleman. While he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
hesitating, he looked into his little boy&#8217;s
face, and he was so pleasant, and looked
so gentle and kind, that the man could
not bear to sell him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I will not sell
my little boy at all. I have kept him a
good while, and taken care of him, and I
love him very much. No, I will not sell
him. I will carry him home, and work
very hard to get bread for him to eat.
And he will be kind, and dutiful, and
obedient, and when I grow old perhaps
he will take care of me. No, no, I would
not sell him for a thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is a fictitious story. It is written
to teach children that if they are good,
and kind, and obedient, their fathers will
love them, and work hard, if necessary,
to get them bread, and will not sell them,
even if any body should offer them a
thousand dollars.</p>
